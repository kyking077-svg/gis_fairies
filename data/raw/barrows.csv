BALLINCOLLIG,KERRY,KE030-080----,KE14708,68203,BOBA,bowl-barrow,52.299461,-9.616146,"Located in the corner of a gently sloping field of the lower south – western slope of Ballincollig hill, the site affords expansive views to the southern half of the compass.  The site is bounded on its southern and south-western sides by a small stream . The site is previously unrecorded and was brought to my attention by the landowner who described it as a small “Liss”. However, the extant remains seem to represent the large central platform of a ring-barrow, 20m in diameter and 0.5m higher than the surrounding land. An encircling ditch, on average 2m wide and 0.3m deep, can be  traced around the northern and south-western sides of the site. Traces of a very denuded outer bank can also be seem to the south-west, where it remains to an internal height of 0.5m, external height of 0.3m and a width of 1.5m. The landowner also pointed out that the surviving ditch remained waterlogged throughout the year and stated that this was due to the presence of a spring, which was visible, in the south-western quadrant.The overall diameter of the site, where all elements are intact, is 26.5m.'

What now survives measures 26.0m E-W by 12.0m N-S ( this does not represent the true N-S diameter because of the truncation by the field boundary ).

Gravel excavation had removed the ridge to the east of the mound, leaving it at the top of a 15m high, gravel cliff. Some disturbance had taken place on the east side of the monument. Its pre-excavation appearance suggested that the monument had been formed by scarping the side of the high point of the gravel ridge and by levelling off its top: excavation, however, revealed that the monument was, in the main, artificially constructed. Beneath the sod, a layer of earth overlay an uneven mantle of largish stones. Beneath this was another layer of earth and an earlier mantle of largish stones, beneath which was the undisturbed glacial gravel. The two mantles of stones merged towards the edge of the mound where a well-constructed retaining wall, four to six courses high, remained at some places (elsewhere it had collapsed into the fosse). It seems possible to selectively, assign several stones to an arc formation. At the centre of the mound, in the earth cover between the two mantles of stones, two partly disarticulated burials were found, laid on a NE—SW axis in a poorly, it at all, prepared grave. One skull, that of a male of 20-30 years, was found beneath the pelvis of the lowermost skeleton while the other, that of a female of 30-40 years, was found about 30cm away from the nearest piece of bone. None of the bones of the spinal column, rib-cage, hands or feet was found. There were no accompanying grave goods nor any artifacts by which the monument can be dated.’ Macalister (Breuil and Macalister 1921-4, 5, footnote 1) records that a boulder carved with 'concentric ciclres' was on a mound to the south of the road to the south the field where the cist (SL014-211----) is located.

This mound had also been dug into in 1924 and when we cleared off the heavy growth of furze which covered this, though not the other tumuli, we found it possible to distinguish the mark of the earlier digging. This operation consisted of the cutting of a trench about 8 feet [2.4m] wide through the centre of the mound, though, as our sections revealed, the trench did not go down to the old ground surface under the tumulus and the digging had not been rewarded by any ""finds."" The soil had been replaced by the earlier investigators but certain irregularities in the surface of the mound marked the extent of their cutting, and the material thrown up formed a slight shoulder round the tumulus on about three-quarters of its circumference.  The sections showed the height of the tumulus above original ground level to be six feet [1.8m]. They showed plainly the cutting made in 1924, but showed also a second small disturbance which, also, did not reach original ground level. This second cutting may have been due to an earlier disturbance or may have been caused by further digging in 1924 of which we were not informed.   On the original ground level we found, over an irregular area of about 18 feet [5.5m] by 16 feet [4.87m], cremated bones and a thin layer of charcoal, evidently the site of the cremation pyre, and the remains of the burial. We have, therefore, in T[umulus] III a second example of the type of burial exemplified also in T [umulus] II, in which a tumulus was raised over the cremated remains on the site where the cremation had taken place' (ibid. 139).

Excavations of the mound (H. 0.9m; diam. 11m) undertaken by Ó Ríordáin between 1934-5, revealed a cist (LI048-034039-) and the barrow was described as following; ‘This mound was low and insignificant in comparison with T [umulus] II [LI048-034012-] and T [umulus] III [LI048-034011-]. Its maximum height over ground-level was less than 3 feet [0.9m], and its greatest diameter about 36 feet [11m]. No signs of a surrounding fosse showed on the surface but there were some upright stones at the edge of the tumulus, others of which were revealed on excavation making a total of six found in position, which represented the remains of the kerb of the tumulus’ (ibid. 133).   Excavations revealed, ‘that the greater portion of it was covered by a paving of small stones packed rather closely together. This paving was at varying depths of 18 inches [0.45m] or less under the surface.  On and among the stones of this paving we found scattered fragments of small deposits of cremated bones’ (ibid. 135).   A possible fosse was also recorded inside the edge of the mound and ‘it did not make a complete circle, there being a gap of about one-fifth of its circumference on the northern side’ (ibid. 136).

Monument is clearly visible today on Digital Globe aerial photography as consisting of a central mound (approx. diam. 8m) enclosed by a possible fosse and external bank (overall ext. diam. 44m).   Compiled by Alison McQueen, Vera Rahilly and Caimin O’Brien.  Date of upload: 08 November 2019  Surveyed in 2013 and described by McGuinness (2014, 54-5) as following: 'Large, roughly subcircular monument (Diam. 47.5m N-S) comprising a subcircular central mound (Diam. 10.2m N-S x  13.2m E-W) surrounded at a considerable distance by a bank, giving the impression of a broad,  shallow ‘ditch’  in  between.  SE  stretch  of  bank  appears  to  have  been  removed,  precluding  a measurement of the E-W diameter of the monument. Although on undulating ground, monument is level when viewed from a distance. Where highest on NW side, central mound rises up to 1.55m above area between mound and bank; it has irregular upper surface, perhaps damaged by cattle but with exposed blocks of limestone visible in places. Other limestone blocks have been incorporated in the outer bank, which is really only a clear bank on the S side, where it reaches up to 3.5m in width and up to 0.45m in height above the interior, being more like a step elsewhere—that is to say the broad level area surrounding the mound simply drops down to external ground level, especially on the N side where the ‘step’ is up to 1.45m high and the ‘bank’ has no clearly defined inner edge. There may be a true ditch immediately inside the bank, giving the overall monument the appearance of a Wessex disc-barrow or of a hengiform ditched enclosure with central mound, but this is by no means certain. Immediately W of monument is a stretch of a second earthen bank, apparently not part of the barrow but running almost tangentially to it and swerving off to NW.  Monument is located in low-lying pastureland with higher ground to S; local landowner pointed out  that  major  drainage  operations  had  taken  place  here  over  the  years,  such  that  large  parts  were previously marshy or fully flooded, immediately to NE and E of the barrow.  Possible Second Barrow (WM030-022----): Less than 150m NNW of monument just described, is another feature which on the surface could be interpreted as a barrow. This greatly damaged monument is preserved only on N side of E-W running field fence, S side of monument apparently having been removed. Although remaining part of monument is by no means regular in appearance or easily classifiable, it appears to comprise an irregular-shaped mound incorporating blocks of limestone and rising to its highest point on E side. This mound appears to be delimited on E and W halves by a bank, but bank on the W side is on markedly higher ground than that on E, being not much lower than the mound itself. It is not certain that the western stretch of ‘bank’ is indeed a bank and it does not obviously join up with the much better defined eastern stretch; if it is accepted that the two banks join up to form one half of the perimeter of the monument, its maximum visible diameter from E to W is 46.5m. There appears to be a slight inner ditch associated with both E and W stretches of bank. On E side, where bank is much more low-lying than on W side, the central mound rises 1.95m above the ‘ditch’ on inside of bank. On E side, bank is 4m in width; on W side it is 2.6m in width. Although this is unclear, eastern stretch of bank appears to veer of",,,,,

Running around edge of mound partway up its slope, though not sticking to the same contour, is what appears to be a step or ledge, but it is unclear to what extent this is artificial or due to slippage, animal traffic or natural erosion; on SE side, upper surface of mound rises 1.65m over this step, which in turn rises 0.50m over ground level. Just 0.7m below top of mound, but only on SE side, is a step or ledge 2.60m in width which appears striking in profile; this appears more likely to be original than the lower, circumferential step. Poaching and other erosion has damaged the mound at various parts of its circumference, especially SE-S-W; and SE edge of mound appears to have been shorn off by passing farm vehicles. Although one ASI account, that of 29/5/78, does note that ‘there is no clear indication of a fosse though there is a slight depression on the NNE side,’ in its current state no perimeter ditch is visible around this tumulus, and its identification as a bowl-barrow by ASI should be rejected in favour of the mound-barrow category. Monument is situated in good pastureland, which has been under the plough in the recent past, perhaps removing evidence for peripheral features. It is prominently positioned on a glacial ridge sloping down from NW-SE, its highest point being 250m to NW of barrow. There are excellent views from E-S-W, and Frewin Hill (WM011-132----/133----/160----) and Knockdrin (WM012-183----), both very prominent hills with barrows, are visible to E.

The Slieve Blooms dominate the view to the S; Knockastia (WM031-015----) and Croghan Hill (OF010-004001-), each with burial mounds, are prominent to NW and E respectively; Ardan Hill, capped by a mound-barrow (WM038-031---), is visible to N.

In later times it was the inauguration site of the Mageoghegans (Mac Eochagáin), chiefs of the Clann Cholmáin subkingdom of Cenél Fiachach.

Flattish summit of mound slopes down to NE, although the overall impression when seen from the SW end of the ridge is that the upper surface of the mound has been kept level in spite of the widely varying micro-topography. Mound is located on NE summit of striking glacial landform comprising a NE-SW running ridge with high points at NE and SW ends and a saddle between, the overall feature appearing like a small steep hill rising from the broad summit of a larger hill. Faint curvilinear earthworks on SW summit, 38m from the mound-barrow,  appear  to  indicate  the  presence  of  one  or  two  barrows  (WM018-146----).  The  entire  basal perimeter of this landform has been delimited by a low bank, scarp or step, outside which is a much-silted ditch, best preserved on the SE side where it is 2.5m in width. The enclosure thus formed is roughly D-shaped (c. 100m NE-SW x c. 80m NW-SE). A low bank, with a possible ditch on its uphill SE side, runs in a SW direction from a point  4.2m NW of mound-barrow obliquely down the slope of NW side of ridge; where best preserved, near its ENE end, this is c. 2.4m in width and rises c. 0.35m above the  ‘ditch’.  Clearest  for a 37m stretch, this appears to  terminate  before  reaching  the  perimeter  of  the  D-shaped enclosure, but at its NE end aerial photographs on the OSI website suggest that it might continue past the mound-barrow, partly clipping off a sector of the D-shaped enclosure on the NW side. Running from midway along the best-preserved stretch of this bank towards the mound-barrow, but not connected to either, is another stretch of low bank, best seen on OSI aerial photographs.

Upper surface of mound was apparently flat-topped originally (Diam. 12m N-S x 12.8m E-W) but centre has been hollowed out irregularly to a depth of up to 0.75m, possibly by people attempting to find a burial. Mound is composed of earth and stone, visible where animals have worn away parts of the edge. Surrounding the mound is a very broad, shallow, circular ditch, which varies from 11-13m in width and reaches up to 0.40m in depth below external ground level; mound rises up to 2.4m above ditch on NE side.   A segment of ditch runs into adjacent field to NW; and, about 9.5m to SSE of mound, line of ditch joins onto, and may even swerve outwards to incorporate, a tiny lake or pool, which is not visible on all OSI aerial photographs and is therefore not always flooded.   Given its breadth, the ditch might perhaps be better described as a circular area from which the material for the mound was scraped. Overall diameter of the monument including this ‘ditch’ is   47.5m NNE-SSW.   Mound, capped by a trigonometrical station (147m OD), is located at N end   of broad, flattish summit of hill which runs in a N-S direction.   Also on summit are a platform-barrow (WM011-022----), only 31m to ESE, and a ring-barrow (WM011-026----), at opposite end of summit c. 250m to S.

Extract from Iris Oifigiúil 25th February 1977.  Portloman Abbey (WM011-145----) and Lough Owel 200m to E, standing stone (WM011-146----) 170m to SSW, bowl-barrow (WM011-139----) 300m to NNW.  In 1912 it was recorded that a medieval graveslab (WM011-145002-) was excavated out of the mound located in the field beside Portloman Church (WM011-145----) and graveyard (WM011-145001-) (Tuite 1912, 69).  The slab 'was found in the centre of the earthwork, on a level with the surrounding land, but there is no tradition that any human remains were underneath. Almost ever since this beautiful old stone has served the ignoble purpose of an improvised footway across the boundary-ditch which separates the farm on which it was found from the adjoining graveyard of Portloman' (Tuite 1912, 69). This mound was described by James Tuite (1912, 69) as following; 'The greater part of the mound still exists, and from examination it would appear that the work of excavation was carefully carried out. At present it stands about 18 feet (5.5m) in height; originally it was probably not more than 22 feet (6.7m).   It is of the usual type we see scattered over the country, and in which Westmeath is particularly rich, especially this west shore of Lough Owel.  In the immediate neighbourhood, and quite near the lake, is the mound of Forraidh, where Fiachra, brother of Nial of the Nine Hostages, was interred (Silva Gadelica); the mounds at Slanemore, associated with the ancient tale, Táin Bó Cuailgne; and the celebrated hill of Fremhain (Frewin); while Portloman itself occupies a very prominent place in Irish ecclesiastical history. I may also add that the Slige Assail, one of the great roads from Tara, runs through the above-named townlands, and its course can be distinctly traced in several places'. The presence of a medieval graveslab underneth the mound suggests that either the mound dates from the medieval period or that it was a prehistoric burial mound reused in the medieval period.    Surveyed in 2012 and described by McGuinness (2012, 31-2) as following: ‘Enormous circular mound (Diam. 34.5m N-S x 35.5m E-W) with rounded, almost conical profile and flat-topped, irregular-shaped summit (Diam. 4.5m N-S x 4.5m E-W), surrounded by relatively shallow ditch, up to 0.3m in depth below external ground level, that is best preserved at SE and running from S to SW. Height of mound above ditch ranges from 3.06m on S side to 4.04m on N side. It is possible that apex of mound may be stepped, as at Slane More (WM018-078----) this effect is most pronounced at S and SW, where there is a clear drop of O.5m. On SE side, the well-defined ditch has what appears to be a counterscarp bank, but this effect seems to be created by a falling off of natural ground-surface just beyond ditch to SE, a topographical feature that can be traced running off from the barrow in a NE direction. Width of ditch ranges from 2.5m at ESE to 5.5m at N, where it is broad, shallow and indistinct, so that overall diameter of monument is 44m N-S x 44m E-W. Even allowing for erosion, size of ditch is completely insufficient to account for the mass of earth in the mound, which might possibly represent a modified kame or other sort of glacial hillock common in this area. Profile of mound is irregular on E and NE sides, as if material has been removed, and it has suffered recent erosion in places due to grazing sheep. There are two mature deciduous trees on E and S edges of mound and others close by, all probably planted in the 18th century.  Monument is situated in low-lying pasture c. 250m to SW of Lough Owel. Beginning 20m to WNW of the barrow is a broad, sunken channel 12m in width and 0.5m in depth, which runs off in a WNW direction.

CROGHANHILL,OFFALY,OF010-004001-,OF00494,106827,BOBA,bowl-barrow,53.346265,-7.278471,"This site is a hilltop prehistoric burial mound (H 3.75m; top diam. 4m; base diam. 21m) standing on the summit of Croghan Hill, with panoramic views of the surrounding landscape.   This extinct volcano and prominent landscape feature in NE Offaly stands 4km SE of the boundary with County Westmeath.  In the mythology of Ireland this hill was called Brí Éile named after Éile, daughter of Eochaidh Feidhleach, king of Ireland, who divided the country into five provinces and their respective provincial kings (O’Donovan 1856, 87-8, 148). The burial mound stands in the Gaelic territory of Uí Failghe (Offaly) ruled by the O’Connor clan in the province of Leinster close to the provincial border with Meath.   According to O’Donovan this burial mound was the ‘monument of Congal’ mentioned in the ‘Laoidh na Leacht’ or ‘Poem of the Monuments’ (Herity 2008, 42).  Congal Cáech was king of the Dál nAraidi in Ulster and ally of the Clann Cholmáin of Westmeath.  He was killed at the battle of Mag Rath in the year 637 AD.      Nearby monuments include Glenmore Holy Wells or St. Patricks Well (OF010-004006-/007-) which lies 460m to the NNE.  A possible fifth century church site (OF010-004002-), known locally as ‘Bishop Mac Caille’s Church’, lies 150m to the E on the shoulder of Croghan Hill.   The deserted medieval village (OF010-010001-) of Croghan, Croghan Church (OF010-010006-) and castle (OF010-010003-), the residence of the O’Connor clan and a medieval road known as ‘The Togher of Croghan’ stands clustered together 920m to the WSW of the hilltop.   In 1997 a small burial ground was partially excavated by Dominic Delany in a field 510m SSW of Croghan Hill and N of Cannakill School.  This burial ground was located between two holy wells (OF010-011-/012---).   The burial mound is annotated as a ‘Carn’ on the 1838 edition of the Ordnance Survey [OS] 6-inch map, however there is no stone material visible on the grass-covered mound and no evidence of any stone kerbing around the base of the monument.  A trig point was constructed by the OS on the summit of the mound which marks the height 769 feet [234m] above sea level.  The burial mound on top of Croghan Hill is a prominent landmark in the landscape of the region which is exaggerated by the low-lying nature of the surrounding countryside.  In 1838 John O’Donovan described the hilltop setting and the extensive views from the mound when he wrote; ‘you can survey at a glance the Clár or level plain of Ofalia and its natural boundaries.  It stretches, nearly as level as a lake southwards to the foot of the Slieve Bloom mountain [27km SW], and to the Sugar Loaf hills at Killowen [Killone 32km], in the Queen’s County [Laois], and eastwards to the hill of Allen [30km SE] in the county of Kildare.  I never enjoyed a finer prospect than that commanded by this hill, which may be called O’Connor Faly’s Carn’ (Herity 2008, 43).  The plain at the foot of Croghan Hill was described in the Irish annals as ‘Magh- Dairbhreach’ or the ‘Plain of the Oaks’ (O’Donovan 1856, 36).The prehistoric mound which presumably covered a grave or graves although not necessarily so consists of a small gently sloping flat-topped earthen mound with the remains of a shallow fosse encircling the base.  Around the base of the mound there are traces of a berm or step which appears to be artificial and could have been caused by grazing livestock.    The summit of the monument was damaged by sappers when they were building the trig point in the 19th century (Herity 2008, 43).   The earthen mound with enclosing fosse suggests that this monument may be the remains of a bowl-barrow possibly dating from the Bronze Age.  Alternatively the mound may cover the remains of a megalithic tomb or a large cist like structure such as a Linkardstown type cist.  It is also possible that the mound may be a multi-period monument covering multiple cists inserted over several centuries.

It appears to be the mound referred to in ASI account of 14/5/81, which specifies that it had been removed in recent years, adding that ‘this however probably related to quarrying (there is a quarry hole nearby) and is not thought therefore to have been an antiquity’ [SMR file]. Given its hilltop location in immediate vicinity of a barrow cemetery, this site must be regarded as a possible mound-barrow or, perhaps more likely, a fifth bowl barrow with shallow ditch.  This hilltop cemetery of six barrows overlooks Lough Lene, which lies 0.5km to S. Although not visible, the important early medieval monastery of Fore lies on lower ground only 1.2km to ENE, at foot of group of hills on N side of Lough Lene, of which the present site is on the westernmost hill. On a sketch-map of Fore and other important pre-Norman locations around Lough Lene prepared for the Ordnance Survey Letters in 1837, John O’Donovan marked three barrows (‘na móitínídhe’) on this hill (Herity (ed.) 2011, Fig. 6), which is labelled ‘Cnoc na Caillíghe’ like the analogously named passage-tomb cemetery at Loughcrew (‘Sliabh na Caillighe’) and other sites of hilltop burial cairns linked to the Cailleach Bheara in folklore. On a prominent hilltop across W end of Lough Lene in Ballany, c. 2.2km to SSW of the barrows, is Ráth an Dúin or Dún Doirbhgheis (‘Turgesius’s Fort’), a remarkable monument (WM007-035----) described by John O’Donovan of the Ordnance Survey in 1837 as consisting of ‘one ring of earth which, enclosing the whole apex of the hill and being adapted to its outline (contour) is nearly of an oval shape, being about 160 feet in breadth and 210 in length. It extends east and west’; although traditionally linked with the Viking Turgesius, O’Donovan argued that this naturally and artificially fortified hill was a seat of Irish kings prior to the time of Turgesius, based on similarities with Dún na Sgiath on Lough Ennell (Herity (ed.) 2011, 172-)’.

Except for a short arc on NW side, there appears to be no clear evidence of a ditch, although the 1973 ASI account also noted similar traces on S side [SMR file]. Where highest at NE, mound rises 2.28m above ground level; at lower NW side, it rises only 1.77m above the visible arc of ditch, which is 3.3m in width and sunk 0.17m below external ground level. Despite the sloping ground on which it is located, upper surface of mound has been kept approximately level, so that the amount of mound-material varies at different points around its circumference; as an illustration of this, the sloping N side of mound, from edge of flat summit to ground level, measures 6.5m, whereas the corresponding dimension on the S side is only 4m. Terraces or ledges at different heights around the sides of the mound appear to be attributable to a combination of solifluction and animal movement.  Barrow lies in pasture on a NW-SE ridge, apparently a kame, to NW of highest point so that it is on ridge top sloping down to NW. Just 4m N of barrow a scoop has been taken from side of ridge; although it has the superficial appearance of a quarry or sand-pit—one ASI fieldworker taking it for a ‘quarry hole’ [SMR file]’— few stones are visible and there is a kind of low bank around the mouth of the hollow on the downhill side: Such features are ubiquitous in the glaciated Westmeath landscape, not uncommonly in the vicinity of barrows (WM020-015----; WM027-020----), and they appear to represent ‘dead-ice hollows’, left when fragments of retreating glaciers left partly embedded in the ground have melted away (pers. comm. Seamus O’Brien); a second such hollow lies just over 60m to E, and both of these were in existence in the 1830s, when depicted on the First Edition OS 6“ map (1838). There is a kettle-hole lake visible 100m to ENE; a second one lies 150m to NNW, and a third lies 170m to ESE, beyond which, and prominently visible 200m to E, is a remarkable fortified glacial ridge hillock, identified as a ringfort (WM013-017----) by the ASI but showing little resemblance to a typical example of that type of monument; instead the irregular-shaped summit of the ridge has traces of a low stone wall around it, with more significant earthen ramparts around its base, now best preserved in the NW quadrant.  Visibility is excellent from the present barrow, with the two denuded mound-barrows (WM013-003----; WM013-112----), or at least their sites, visible 1.5km to NE on opposite side of valley of the Drumhurlin River; the unclassified-barrow (WM013-020----) near the summit of a low hill c. 750m to E would be visible but for trees.

CLONDALEVER (Moyashel & Magheradernon By.),WESTMEATH,WM013-020----,WM00980,128237,BOBA,bowl-barrow,53.6007,-7.223408,"Monument surveyed in 2015 and described by McGuinness (2015, 43-4) as following: ‘Steep sided mound (Diam. 11.60m N-S x 12m E-W) with gently domed upper surface (Diam. 8m N-S x 7.70m E-W), perhaps originally approximately circular but now angular in appearance, with rounded ‘corners’ on S side where roots of mature trees have held the mound together, and an almost straight line on W side where poaching by animals and slippage have occurred; other erosion is clearly evident on N and S sides, where large chunks have been removed. That the mound has been reshaped at some stage is indicated by the presence of a much eroded dry-walled revetment on SW side, with a surviving length of 1m and maximum height of 0.50m. This walling runs partly under the base of a mature ash tree and might have been added sometime in the last few hundred years to support this large tree at the mound’s edge, where it might otherwise have toppled to SW, although loose stones at base of NW side of mound may indicate that the walling ran around a longer stretch of the perimeter. Mound rises up to 1.70m above ground level where highest on W side. To N and S are traces of a low step or scarp extending up to 6m (N) and 4.20m (S) from base of mound. What appears to be an arc of ditch, 1.80m across and sunk 0.16m below external ground level, runs for 4.30m along base of NE side of mound, but, while the ASI account of 4/5/76 refers to ‘a shallow fosse around the earthwork & a low irregular bank beyond it’ [SMR file], and that of 9/3/70 refers to ‘a shallow trench dug around  [the mound] from SE-S-NE’ [SMR file], no clear trace of a ditch is currently visible except at NE; and the ASI fieldworkers were uncertain of this monument’s status as a barrow, one wondering whether ‘The bank and fosse may not be original features’ [SMR file]; presumably this ‘bank’ equates with the low step or scarp visible on the N and S sides of the mound. According to the ASI account of 9/3/70: ‘Some years ago a cross-bar was inserted in this mound and disappeared from view. Locals believe on this account that there is a cave in it.’ Possibly this is a cist.  Monument lies immediately W of a field fence running NNW-SSE, which marks the boundary between landholdings and passes over E edge of mound. It is located on a low, gently rounded hill that drops much more steeply down to N than to S; slope on E side is similar to that on W, in neither instance quite so steep as on N side. Three other hilltop-barrows in this townland would be visible but for trees: a mound- or bowl-barrow (WM013-016----) c. 750m to W and two denuded mound-barrows (WM013-003----; WM013-112----) on N side of valley of the Drumhurlin River c.1.2km to N’.

CHRISTIANSTOWN,WESTMEATH,WM008-009----,WM00425,143241,BOBA,bowl-barrow,53.670036,-7.187297,"Monument surveyed in 2015 and described by McGuinness (2015, 38) as following: ‘Large, well-preserved and very impressive bowl-barrow (Diam. 36m N-S x 37.3m E-W), comprising a tall circular mound shaped like an upturned bowl (Diam. 16.5m N-S x 17.7m E-W), but its steeply sloping and straight to gently rounded sides and distinct rounded apex give it a nearly conical shape; the mound is surrounded by a circular ditch, outside which is a bank. The slope of the constructed mound is for the most part continued in the profile of the ditch, although it is unclear to what extent this effect is due to slip from the mound, particularly as the mound originally appears to have been kerbed (see below). On NE side mound reaches a height of 3m above base of ditch. The ASI account notes ‘slight terracing of the side of the mound – particularly on the NE-E – due to soil slip’ [SMR file]. Several boulders protrude from a similar level part way up the mound, at various points from SE-S-W, two being closely set near base of constructed part of mound, i.e. original ground level before ditch was dug. These seem to be remnants of a retaining kerb, although they appear to be slightly above rather than at base of constructed part of mound. Noting two of these, the ASI account dismisses them as ‘probably part of the make-up of the mound’ [SMR file], but the fact that they are at a similar height close to original ground-level suggests that this is a kerb. The broad, deep, flat-based ditch has widths of 5.1m (N), 4.8m (E), 5.1m (S), 4.2m (W); on SSE side where there are thorn trees, it has been severely poached by sheltering animals, and much very stony soil is exposed; some of the larger stones in the ditch, noted also by ASI fieldworkers [SMR file], are field clearance. The outer bank has a range of greatest widths similar to those for the ditch (4.6m (N), 5.9m (E), 3.8m (S), 4.5m (W)), although its flat top is only 1m across, and, where best preserved at E, it rises 1.3m over the ditch and 0.75m over external ground level. Where poaching has taken place, both mound and outer bank can be seen to be of very stony earth, the bank being particularly so on NE side; the ASI account similarly notes ‘a good deal of stone showing in the make up of the mound’, up to the level of its summit. the ASI account of 18/5/73 identifies it more confidently as a bowl-barrow [SMR file]. Barrow is located in pastureland on a low rise at end of a NW-SW ridge in undulating glacial drift, with poor visibility; about 90m to SSE is a kettle-hole lake, and a second such lake lies at a greater distance to NE. Barrow lies 1.2km to N of E end of Lough Lene and c. 2.75km to ESE of the early medieval monastery of Fore.  Compiled by: Caimin O'Brien based on details provided by David McGuinness.

Identified by Margaret Gowen in 1986 as Site 2/38/3 during archaeological monitoring of topsoil stripping associated with the Irish Gas pipeline (Gowen 1988, 68-72). The results of her excavations were summarised as follows; ‘Several well-defined cremation pits were noted on this site after removal of topsoil. An area 8m x 6.50m cleared for excavation revealed an enclosing ring-ditch. The ring-ditch was horseshoe-shaped in plan and enclosed an area 5.80m x 4.20m. The opening at the west was 3m wide where the ditch ended in two rounded, west-facing terminals. Three deposits of fill were noted in all five cuttings opened across it. The uppermost contained some large stones, concentrations of cremated bone and at one point a fragment, roughly one quarter, of a pot. There were no other artefacts found on the site. The ditch appeared to have been truncated on the west and south, having a maximum width of 1.30m, and was 30-50cm deep.  Six cremation pits were placed roughly in the centre of the enclosed area. The largest measured 80cm x 90cm x 29cm, four were roughly 30cm in diameter and 23-30cm deep, and the sixth was just 20-24cm in diameter. Not all the pits contained significant quantities of cremated bone and one which appeared to have none at all during excavation may be a post hole, Where it was possible to identify the mains, all the bones were human and appeared to be those of single individuals’ (www.excavations.ie 1986, Site No. 58).

Excavation of 4 of these [LI049-230/233----] took place over an 8-week period in July and August, 1992. The site is defined by a U-sectioned ditch. At the south-east the ditch extends outwards to define a crescentic area or shelf. On the exterior edge of the main ditch deep tool marks, the result of using a mattock or similar implement, were found. The inner edge of the ditch is a neat, almost vertical face. Tiny bone fragments were found in the ditch silt but are too fragmentary to be identified (Barra Ó Donnabháin, pers. comm.). The mound was built of material from the ditch. It survived to a maximum height of 0.1 8m. A second curvilinear ditch was located within the central area of the barrow. This is semi-circular in plan. It cut through the mound of Barrow 54 and thus post-dates it. In modern times the mound was flattened and the ditch had been deliberately filled. Finds include a fragment of chert debitage, a humanly modified chert pebble, a slightly burnt flint flake, a chert scraper and a fragment of a whetstone. The disturbance dates to the recent past as it contained modern delph and iron fragments.DiscussionThe Mitchelstowndown West sites form a clear element of the barrow complex and the associated funerary tradition in the Morningstar Valley and probably date to the Middle to Late Bronze Age. Because there is no conclusive evidence that the barrows had a funerary function it is postulated that burial deposits had become so token that the barrows’ function had become a symbolic monument associated with burial rituals and perhaps with remembrance of the dead’ (Daly and Grogan 1993, 43-4).

Recorded as Site No. 62 when excavated by Aoife Daly and Eoin Grogan of Discovery Programme in 1992, the results of which were summarised as follows; ‘The cemetery of Mitchelstowndown West near Knocklong contains 53 small barrows. Excavation of 4 of these [LI049-230/233----] took place over an 8-week period in July and August, 1992. Barrow 62 has a gently curved ditch profile. In the ditch a sterile silty deposit accumulated. It contained some tiny fragments of bone but this is too fragmentary to be identified as to species (Barra Ó Donnabháin, pets. comm.). The upper fill consisted of more solid material, probably derived from the mound of which there was no surviving evidence,DiscussionThe Mitchelstowndown West sites form a clear element of the barrow complex and the associated funerary tradition in the Morningstar Valley and probably date to the Middle to Late Bronze Age. Because there is no conclusive evidence that the barrows had a funerary function it is postulated that burial deposits had become so token that the barrows’ function had become a symbolic monument associated with burial rituals and perhaps with remembrance of the dead’ (Daly and Grogan 1993, 44).

Bronze age ditch-barrow (site TR/2/16/2) excavated in 1986 by Eoin Grogan on the Bórd Gáis Éireann Curraleigh West-Limerick gas pipeline (Gowen 1988, 72-79). The results of this excavation were summarised as following; ‘The first feature revealed was part of the outline of a ring-barrow [LI049-059001-]  extending onto the corridor from the fence line. Machine skimming of the surrounding area (which removed a further 5-10cm of topsoil) revealed the majority of the features excavated (LI049-059001-/004-). Two further ditch features were revealed after trenching in an area which was not accessible during excavation.  The ring-ditch - There were two main features, a central ring-ditch contained within a ditched enclosure [LI049-059002-], along with a complex of features including a hearth pit containing coarse undecorated pottery, eight further pits and twenty-two post and stake holes. Only one third of the ring-ditch was available for excavation. It was defined by a gapped trench enclosing part of a circle roughly 7m in diameter. It was 24-56cm wide and c. 40cm deep. Two gaps occurred in the excavated portion, one of which (48cm wide) was spanned by a narrow slot trench. The second gap was at least 1m wide extending beyond the fence line. Within the enclosed area, c. 30cm from the inner ditch edge, was a concentric trench, forming part of a possible discontinuous inner ditch. A very small sample of unidentifiable fragments of burnt bone was recovered from the outer ditch fill, along with two small sherds of coarse undecorated pottery. The outer enclosure ditch appeared to be a contemporary feature. The exposed portion described roughly one quarter of a circular or oval enclosure with a diameter of approximately 20m. It was 80cm in maximum width and 30cm deep. The hearth pit within this feature and lying 5.50m from the ring-ditch measured 64cm x 59cm x 6cm and had a charcoal-rich fill of clay and heat-shattered stones. Ten sherds of coarse undecorated pottery were recovered from the fill. One of the eight pits (73cm x 45cm x 33cm) contained e substantial portion of a single coarse undecorated pot. The post and stake holes within the enclosure formed no interpretable plan.

The results were frankly disappointing as no unmistakable burial was found in any of the barrows excavated.  In one some scattered fragments of cremated bone were found, but it was not possible to say if these were human; in another three pockets filled with dark humified soil were revealed which may have marked disintegrated burials. Several solutions may be suggested to account for these negative results. It would appear on the available evidence probable that the majority of the burials were not contained in urns, and that they were burials after cremation. This being the case one may suppose on the evidence of the softness of the bones found in the Lissard barrow that an acid soil acting on the unprotected cremated remains completely dissolved them, leaving no trace. Another factor which we have to consider is the little protection afforded by the slight central mound. This was obviously formed by piling up some of the material from the comparatively shallow ditch, part going to the construction of the surrounding bank’ (Ó Ríordáin 1936, 177).

The slightly sunken circular ring which marked the position of the ditch was the most distinctive feature and was frequently to be noticed by reason of its wetness as compared with the surrounding ground, this causing the vegetation in it to be fresher and greener’.

Subsequent excavation revealed a circular area (diam. c. 4.25m) defined by a fosse (Wth 0.81-1m; D 0.31m) best preserved along the N arc. The fills in the fosse were of sandy clays. Flecks of charcoal indicate that burning had occurred in the area when the fosse was open. A second phase of activity occurred after the fosse was back-filled and consisted of a narrow fosse or slot being dug along and into the fills on the inner edge of the original ditch barrow. The fills of this second fosse were charcoal rich and included fragments of cremated human bone. The small amount of bone recovered suggests that it was only a token deposit. Evidence of burning in-situ from the upper fills of this second fosse produced a radiocarbon date of cal. BC 349-43 (UB-6770). The excavator suggests that this ditch barrow may be associated with the complex of Bronze Age/Iron Age monuments (CO044-073001- - CO044-073014-) immediately to the NE that were also excavated on the route of the N8.

There are a number of circular impressions immediately E of this mound, on the top of the natural rise, which have been created by cattle poaching around ring-feeders. The mound and fosse of the possible monument is more defined, the fosse being deeper and the mound therefore more accentuated, than the neighbouring circular impressions. Also its location in a hollow seems a poor choice for a ring-feeder. According to the landowners they don’t remember a ring-feeder ever being positioned in the hollow. However, similar to the neighbouring ring-feeders, there are a lot of nettles growing on the mound and in the fosse which suggests that the ground was more recently disturbed.

An archaeological site consisting of a curvilinear V-shaped ditch was identified by Ken Hanley during the stripping of topsoil prior to development work being carried out behind the Riverrun House at Terryglass village in 1998 (Hanley 2000, 202). The site was partially excavated by Paul Stevens in November of 1998 and revealed a V-shaped ditch (Wth 2.8m; D 0.75m) from NE through S to SW which probably enclosed an area approximately 40m in diameter (Stevens 2000, 202). The fill of the excavated ditch contained a layer of charcoal with one tiny fragment of cremated bone. A second ditch feature abutting the larger ditch at E was also uncovered. The excavator suggested that it was possibly contemporary with the larger ditch although this could not be fully established without further excavation. The charcoal layer with cremated bone suggests that this was the site of a funerary monument measuring approximately 40m in diameter (ibid., 202).  Compiled by: Caimin O'Brien.

OXPARK,TIPPERARY NORTH,TN011-038----,TN04042,158327,DTBA,ditch barrow,52.949803,-8.036918,"Situated in gently undulating pastureland on a natural rise of ground, 500m N of Cloghjordan House (TN016-001003-) and the historic village of Cloghjordan (TN016-001----).  Geophysical survey carried out under licence No. 06R020 in this field in 2006 discovered the site of a ditch-barrow located immediately to the W of a levelled enclosure (TN011-029----).  Subsequent archaeological test trenching of this monument by Emer Dennehy on behalf of Margaret Gowen & Co. Ltd. in 2006 under licence number 06E0257 confirmed the feature as that of a ditch-barrow (TN011-038----) and suggested the possibility that the large enclosure (TN011-029----) may be the site of a prehistoric ritual enclosure rather than that of a possible medieval ringfort (Dennehy 2009, 490).  The monument survives in-situ.  The test excavation results were summarised by Dennehy (2009, 490) as following; 'The proposed development at Cloughjordan comprises a 67-acre site within which a ‘sustainable village’ is to be constructed. A total of 133 mixed residential units will be constructed on the southern twenty acres of the site and 30% of the development site will be used for woodlands with the remaining 40% used for agricultural activity. The site is in a rich archaeological and historical environment, with the three RMP sites located within or adjacent to the development. These sites, namely the moated site (TN011–028----) and Cloughjordan Castle (TN016–001----), attest the Anglo-Norman occupation of the area. The enclosure site [TN011-029----], though levelled, is illustrated on cartographic sources and was perceived to be medieval in date. However, a late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age ring-barrow (ext. diam. 16m) was identified immediately adjacent to the enclosure and now suggests the enclosure could be prehistoric.  Initial investigations involved a detailed geophysical survey (06R020) and this was followed by an archaeological impact assessment targeting known and suspected areas of archaeological activity'.  Archaeological test trench 12 which was opened across the SW quadrant of the barrow uncovered the disarticulated remains of skeletal material including skull fragments and a long bone which were left in-situ. This skeletal material was found at two locations within the interior of the barrow.  A section of the ditch of the barrow was excavated revealed that it was V-shaped in profile measuring 1.1m deep by 1.4m wide at the top and narrowing to 0.1m at the base (Dennehy 2006, 18).  See attached images showing location of barrow site, taken from Dennehy 2006.

There were five major layers in the fosse which indicated a history of original construction as a ring-barrow, with a little silting followed by some cremated deposits in the fosse at N. Further silting separated these from a second deposit of cremations. The ditch was sealed with redeposited natural, which appeared to have come from the central mound.  A trench (dims 3m x 0.7m; D 0.3m) was subsequently dug into the fosse at N and filled with charcoal-rich deposits including burnt bone, although not confirmed as human. Some flint debitage and a pot boiler were recovered from this phase. Further re-cuts were made in the fosse with two more cremated deposits, one with an iron nail. Three pits c. 12m to the W, some with cremated bone are probably related to the ditch-barrow (ibid. 2009, 25-7). The barrow was re-used in the Iron Age when a crouched burial was inserted into the fills of the ditch at SSW. The grave-cut (dims 1.3m x 0.66m; D 0.55m) contained a single individual facing W. Grave goods consisted of three copper alloy toe-rings. It proved impossible to produce a radiocarbon date, but toe-rings have been found on comparable graves in Britain and a date of first century BC / AD can be suggested (ibid. 36-7).

No concentrations of human bone were noted, and nor was there evidence of a covering mound or an outer bank (ibid. 23). Two pits within and six in the vicinity are probably associated with its use, and many of these contained some fragments of burnt bone, although articulated animal bone was also present in one of the pits (Schweitzer 2009, 22-5).

Monument was described as following; 'Ring-ditch was annular in plan with a 3.5m internal diameter and a depth of only 0.2m. The shallow nature of the ring ditch is possibly indicative of modern truncation though ploughing. C3 contained a main silty sand fill (C4) present throughoutthe length of the feature along with four primary charcoal deposits recorded along the base(C25, C37, C41 & C43). These primary deposits did not appear to contain any burnt bone inclusions. Two middle charcoal deposits (C6 & C21) did not appear to contain burnt bone either. Three definite discrete cremation deposits (C5, C10 and C42) containing frequent charcoal and moderate burnt bone inclusions were recorded directly above the main fill (C4). A possible heat affected flint chunk was retrieved from cremation deposit C42.  The cremation deposits were all shallow in nature which suggests they were deposited on the backfilled barrow ditch and were not contained in individual cremation pits.  A small shallow circular pit (C30) was recorded less than 1m to the east of the ring barrow and it contained a single silty sand fill with moderate charcoal inclusions. The function of pit C30 may be associated in some form with the ring barrow (C3), however no other features were recorded in the periphery of the ring barrow' (Ní Cheallacháin and Spencer 2020, 36-7).Compiled by: Caimin O’BrienDate of upload: 10 November 2020",,,,,

QUIGNALECKA,MAYO,MA030-093----,MA08287,102586,MOBR,mound barrow,54.12118,-9.130926,"In a housing estate on the outskirts of Ballina town. Originally situated on a low knoll, providing good views of the surrounding undulating landscape, with the Ox Mountains defining the far horizon to the SE, and Nephin Mountain prominently visible to SW. The confluence of the River Moy with its tributary the Brusna River is located 700m to SW.  In 2007 this mound barrow was archaeologically tested in advance of a housing development (Fitzpatrick and Rooney 2007; 070E0627), and it was subsequently fully excavated (Wallace 2018; 070E0627 extension). Following the excavation, the knoll on which the barrow was sited was completely removed. Prior to excavation, the barrow consisted of a circular earthen mound (diam. 12m E-W; 13.8m N-S; H c. 1mm) defined by a scarp. The scarp (H 0.8m at E; 0.7m at W) was lower, and broadly slumped on the N half, but was significantly steeper (H c. 1.7m) at S where it was enhanced by the natural fall of ground. The top of the mound (diam. 9m E-W; 10.8m N-S) was relatively flat, but an almost seamless break of slope with the scarp gave it a gently domed profile when viewed from a distance. An ash tree and a whitethorn tree were growing on the eastern side of the mound, and their root systems disturbed the stratigraphy of the mound. Excavation revealed that a fosse (Wth 0.40-0.50m; D 0.30-0.40m) curved around the mound at NW?E; it could not be traced on the steeply sloping S side, where there was much scree and mudstone bedrock. It was difficult to investigate and record as it had been partly truncated by works associated with the housing development.  Beneath the topsoil, the mound was covered by a layer (D 0.3-0.4m) of mid-brown silty clay, incorporating a high concentration of medium-large stones, and an array of artefacts (pottery, iron nails, a clay pipe stem and lumps of mortar) dating to the modern era. Beneath this, there was a distinctive layer (0.10-0.40m) of yellow-orange, fine sand, which spread over the top of the platform, and in parts extended into the fosse. A large, flat slab was centrally located within this layer. The surface of the slab was covered by a lens of charcoal and ashy material, and surrounding the slab were several patches of charcoal and scorching, as well as heat-shattered granite rocks. The slab rested on a layer (D 0.15m) of loosely compacted, grey-brown silt, underneath which was a subcircular pit (diam. c. 1.2m; D 0.50m), with uneven sides, roughly lined with stones. A piece of worked flint and tiny fragments of burnt bone were recovered from the pit fill. Intense scorching around the pit suggested that this was the location of a cremation pyre; a small channel on the NW side of the pit may have been where a bellows was used to increase temperatures. Three other roughly circular pits were found beneath the yellow sandy layer on the S side of the mound, one of which contained fragments of pottery. The pottery was identified as a rim and neck sherd of a slightly open, shouldered or carinated bowl of the Western Neolithic Tradition, belonging to an early stage within the tradition, with a date centred on 3700 BC thought likely (Dr. A. L. Brindley, in Wallace 2018, Appendix 2). The finds assemblage also includes a flint scarper and a fragment of worked flint, which were recovered during the initial test excavation (Fitzpatrick and Rooney 2007, 17 & 19). A charcoal sample from one of the pits produced a radiocarbon date in the late Neolithic period of 2880-2580 BC (95.4% probability). The Neolithic date for activity at this site is particularly interesting, as barrow type monuments are known to date in the main to the Bronze Age and Iron Age periods. (Wallace 2018).

During the quarrying, a cremated burial with food vessel was exposed. Further burials were uncovered in 1939. The National Museum subsequently undertook an excavation of the barrow, approximately half of which had already been disturbed or destroyed (Raftery 1960, 79-93). The excavation revealed that the barrow (diam. c. 13m; H c. 1m) consisted of a circular mound (H c. 0.6m) of brown sandy soil on top of which, slightly to N of centre, there was a cairn of stones. The cairn was defined by a U-shaped setting of kerb stones. Underlying the barrow were nine graves -five pits or possible pits and four cists -which were built on or dug into the underlying subsoil. In all, the pits and cists contained the cremated remains of thirteen, possibly fourteen individuals, two of which were children. It was not possible to determine the gender of the remains. Food vessel pots accompanied the cremations in five of the graves. The evidence suggested that all the burials had been deposited at the same time, and then covered by the mound barrow.

Subcircular grass-covered mound (dims 20.6m N-S; 17.3m E-W; H 1.2m) which was excavated and reconstructed in 1966-7 (Ó Ríordáin 1997). It consisted of a cairn (RO028-204002-) (diam. 13m N-S; 14m E-W; H 1.5m) defined by a drystone facing (H up to 0.5m) with a line of kerbstones E-SE where cremated bone was recovered. Eight cists were recovered under the cairn, within it, and outside it, containing a total of eight Bowl Food Vessels, a fragment of a bowl, the cremated remains of fourteen individuals, and three inhumations.   The cairn was covered in a clay mound (diam. c. 20m; H 1.5m), taking on the appearance of a mound barrow, and six secondary burial pits, largely in the mound, contained the cremated remains of ten individuals, fragments of two Vase Urns, an almost complete Vase Urn, a bowl, fragment of a bowl, a bone disc and a bronze dagger. Graves 1, 3, and 13 were in the old ground surface or the subsoil and probably pre-date the building of the cairn. Grave 2 was within the cairn close to its centre, and is probably contemporary with the building of the cairn. All the other cists and the pits appear to have been inserted in the cairn after the addition of the clay mantle.   Grave 1 is a cist (RO028-204003-) (int. dims 0.56m E-W; 0.5m N-S; H 0.3m) with a capstone (dims c. 1.45m x c. 0.8m) which contained a bowl food vessel and scattered cremation set into the old ground surface c. 2m inside the perimeter of the cairn at NE.

It was close to the centre within the cairn. Grave 3 is a cist (RO028-204005-) (int. dims 0.38m E-W; 0.35m N-S; H 0.35m) with a double capstone (dims c. 0.87m x c. 0.8m; T 0.35m) which contained a bowl food vessel and an inhumed child. It was set in the subsoil c. 1.2m outside the kerb at N. Grave 13 is a cist (RO028-204010-) (int. dims 0.84 N-S; 0.57m E-W; H 0.52m) with a capstone (dims. c. 1.5m x 1.15m) which contained two bowl food vessels and a large deposit of cremated bone. It was set in the subsoil just NW of the centre of the cairn.  Grave 4 is a cist (RO028-204006-) (int. dims 0.5m N-S; 0.35m E-W; H0.3m) with a capstone (dims 0.8m x 0.75m) which contained a small amount of cremated bone.

Grave 5 is a cist (RO028-204007-) (int. dims 0.7m NW-SE; 0.5m NE-SW; H 0.3m) with a capstone (dims 0.83 x 0.72m) which contained a cremation, a fragment of pottery and a bone pendant or bead. It was situated in the cairn spill at E and had been inserted into the mound. Grave 8 is a cist (RO028-204008-) (int. dims 1.17m N-S; 0.52m E-W; H 0.65m) with a capstone (dims. 2.25 N-S; 2m E-W; T 0.3m) which contained a bowl food vessel with a scattered cremation. It was inserted in the mound at E, inside the kerbstones of the cairn. Grave 8a is a cist (RO028-204009-) (int. dims 0.63m E-W; 0.44m N-S; H 0.27m) with a capstone (dims 1.05m x 0.95m) which contained a bowl food vessel and cremated deposit. Beneath the paving stones was further cremated material probably from the same event as those above. It is in the mound at SE.   Grave 6 is a pit burial (RO028-204011-) containing cremated remains, fragment of a Vase Urn, and a pygmy cup. It was in the mound at S. Grave 7 is a pit burial (RO028-204012-) containing cremated bone, unburnt human and animal bone and is situated in the mound at the centre. Grave 9 is a pit burial (RO028-204013-) containing fragments of a Vase Urn and a small cremation deposit. It was in the mound just SE of the centre.

During excavation the ‘entire mound’ was removed, although the last three days were ‘devoted to restoring it as nearly as possible to its original appearance’; the reconstructed mound survives and according to a 1982 ASI account measures about 14m (N-S) x 15m (E-W), is 1.5-2m high, and slopes appreciably from SE to NW. Before excavation the cairn appeared as ‘a low, flat, grassy mound with a slight depression in the middle, [which] measured 60 feet [18.3m] in diameter and no more than  4 feet [1.2m] high at its highest point. In general, however, it was not much over 3 feet [0.91m] high’. Excavation showed the cairn to be composed of a core of stones ‘merely thrown together with no attempt at walling or any other arrangement’, and with dark soil between them and covering them, ‘so that only a few stones were visible on the surface’; a large limestone boulder on the natural ground was incorporated in W half of monument (Hencken and Movius 1932-4, 233-4).   The  excavation  uncovered  a  very  large  group  of  burials  reflecting  a  broad  variety  of  burial customs, including four inhumations in cists or unprotected, and thirty-nine cremations ‘in cists, in pots, in mere spaces between the stones, upon the earth at the base of the cairn, or in holes made in the original ground level below it’ (ibid., 248). Charcoal mixed with the cremations indicated that the funeral pyres were uniformly of oak. There was no evidence of a central, primary burial, most of the burials being located in the SE part of the cairn, ‘and indeed one small area in this vicinity, 17½ feet long by 4 feet wide, and running north and south, contained all the objects other than the pots that were found with burials’ (ibid., 249). These objects comprised three bronze shaving-razors, scraps of bronze, bone cylinders, a plano-convex flint knife and a rock crystal; much later in date, but found isolated deep within in the cairn, was an early medieval penannular brooch, possibly associated with one of the skeletons  ‘which must be a later intrusion in the cairn’ (ibid., 252-3). The pottery, though not so tightly distributed as the other grave goods, was again confined to the S and E quadrants, and amounted to ten pots, among which a Bowl Food Vessel, a Vase Food Vessel, an Encrusted Urn, a Vase Urn and a Cordoned Urn were identified. Also found were three pits dug in the original ground surface, containing ox, horse and sheep or goat bones, which, along with  signs  of  intense  conflagrations  beneath  the  cairn,  were  interpreted  as ‘probably traces  of  some ceremonial that took place before the cairn was erected’ (ibid., 247).   Cairn is on summit of very prominent limestone hill known as Knockast or Knockastia. The 1982 ASI account of the site gives a sense of the dramatic location of this monument: Situated on prominent knoll at NW end of ridge running approx NW-SE. Rock outcrop in the form of a crag bounds the spur on which site is situated from S to W. Ground falls away sharply on all other sides from ESE-E-NE-N-NW. [SMR file]  In the 1930s the name of this hill was pronounced ‘Knock Costha’ or ‘Connacostha’ and it appears to be the Cnoc in Coscair referred to in the medieval text Bruiden Da Chocae, in which ‘Eochain Bece, having gone away out of a battle described, fell on Cnoc Ni Coscair after weariness of conflict, so that there are many graves on it and it is called Beces Hill’ (Shaw 1921, 142-3; Hogan 1910, 275; Hencken and Movius 1932-4, 2).

Mound rises up to 2m in height above surrounding ground on NW side, its stony cap being up to 0.51m in height. Protruding boulders are visible at various points around the edge of the mound, with a row of them on the S side; it is unclear whether these are natural or form part of a kerb. On NE side of mound is a low, subrectangular projection (L. 3.5m; W. 3m) with boulders along its E side. A second low projection on W side might represent spill from mound. This mound appears to have been shaped from a natural landform.  Tumulus was excavated by Macalister and Praeger after hearing a story that it ‘had been violated in comparatively recent times, and that a cist had been found within it’; they ‘trenched through the mound’ but ‘no evidence was found by us to shew that such a structure had ever existed’. The only feature they noted, aside from a rusty iron hook just under the sod and a broken quartzite pebble close to NNE edge of mound, was as follows: At one place within and near the top of the mound the stones seemed to have been laid intentionally, in an arc 25’ [c. 7.6m] in diameter, surrounding the centre; but nothing was found within it.   No account of the excavation was provided, so it is unclear where their trench was dug or whether they accurately reconstructed the monument afterwards. Geophysical prospection by Roseanne Schot in 2005 and 2009, indicates that an arc of ditch surviving to N of the barrow originally formed part of an enormous hilltop enclosure (WM024-187----), defined by a rock-cut ditch and containing the barrow, which encircled the eastern summit of the Hill of Ushnagh (Schot 2010, 6).   4m-wide gap in enclosure at ENE, defined by the inwardly curved ends of the ditch, indicates an entrance aligned on the centrally positioned barrow.   Barrow lies near E end of broad summit of Hill of Ushnagh, directly N of the conjoined, figure-of-eight-shaped early medieval fort excavated by Macalister and Praeger, and precisely on a line that takes in part of the ancient avenue approaching this fort from the S and continues on to the Togherstown ringfort and tumulus at the north end of the Uisneach complex. There is a small, shallow pond 21m to N; farther N again is a larger kettle-hole lake, beyond which is another barrow (WM024-030----).  Frewin Hill (WM011-131----) and Knockdrin (WM012-032----), sites of hilltop barrows (McGuinness 2012, 28, 34-5), are visible to NE and ENE respectively'.  In 2009 a geophysical survey was undertaken in the field enclosing the mound barrow and the results were described as following; 'A prominent mound (WM024-173----), 1.7m high and about 20m in diameter, crowns the summit of the hill and is probably the monument identified in Dindshenchas as Carn Lugdach or the Sidan, where the god Lugh is said to have been buried after being drowned in the nearby lake (Schot, forthcoming; Gwynn 1924, 278-9). The reported discovery of a cist within the mound sometime prior to the 1920s (Macalister and Praeger 1928, 83) suggests that this may be a bowl-barrow of early Bronze Age date.  Magnetic gradiometry survey conducted around the mound in 2005 revealed a host of previously unrecorded archaeological features, including a curvilinear feature that was suspected to form part of a large enclosure encircling the eastern summit of the hill (Schot 2005). Evidenced as an arc-shaped, positive magnetic band curving from north to southeast across the western part of the surveyed area, this feature corresponds with a broad, shallow depression skirting the edge of the elevated plateau overlooking Lough Lugh (WM024-064002-), to the east, but exhibits no obvious surface trace elsewhere.

A single cutting on NW circumference revealed no evidence of a surrounding ditch, nor was there surface evidence for one farther out. Mound was of compact brown earth with some stone, on a layer of pasty grey clay which included a layer of charcoal covering the original ground surface including the central area; from the surviving stratigraphy, excavator believed mound to belong to a single construction phase, with the grey layer interpreted as a layer of turfs spread over the charcoal before rest of mound was constructed. Excavation of surviving portion of mound, comprising most of NE quadrant, uncovered four discrete cremation burials or collections of burials, along with three small pockets of cremated bone. Burial A, the remains of an adult, were covered by an Early-Middle Bronze Age Cordoned Urn; Burial B, containing at least one adult, had the barest stone protection and no grave goods; Burial C, comprising a large pile of cremated bones including adult remains and a c. 16-year-old youth, was enclosed by a half-destroyed polygonal cist, and contained two men’s shaving razors of a similar type to those found in the Knockast mound-barrow (Kavanagh 1991, 98-100); Burial D comprised some unprotected and unaccompanied adult remains. Given the poor condition of the bones from the burials and cremation-pockets, the total number of bodies and age and gender distribution could not be ascertained beyond the recognition of 5+ bodies including adults and children.  In the charcoal layer under core of mound was found a curved piece of thin bronze of unknown function; also found somewhere near centre of mound, at the lowest level, were fragments of a miniature vessel or Pygmy Cup.  The excavator took all this material to be contemporary as the mound was a single-phase construction. The ASI fieldworker who visited the site in 1979 was informed of similar pots having been found by a Mr Ross while working his land prior to the excavation of the barrow ‘to the E side of the road [from the barrow]’, suggesting the possibility that the barrow was just one component of a larger Bronze Age cemetery [SMR file].

Mound is covered by trees and other vegetation, making it difficult to examine in places; as such, only a single diameter measurement could be recorded. Mound rises up to 5.8m above surrounding ground on NE side. Monument is located in a fluvioglacial landscape, with numerous kames in the area—two close set kames form a ridge just SW of the mound—and has presumably been moulded from such a glacial landform given that there is no trace of a ditch from which the material for the massive mound might have derived; the landowner did, however, inform the writer that the soil around the mound was of a different quality to elsewhere in the same field, which might indicate that topsoil was scraped from a broad area to construct the mound or, more likely, enlarge an existing landform. On NW side, mound seems to taper off gradually to the natural ground, making it difficult to identify its edge. Around circumference of mound at varying heights are narrow terraces apparently due to soil-flow and/or animal movement; certainly a few parts of the mound have been poached by animals, showing it to be composed of earth with some stones. Although this prominent monument has the proportions of a Norman motte, and looks superficially like one, it has neither bank, ditch nor bailey, and its domed upper surface is unlike the flat top more usual for a motte.

This stone was not seen by the writer and appears to have been since removed. It is uncertain whether this mound is natural or artificial and it is accepted as a possible burial mound only on account of its proximity to a ring-/stepped-barrow (WM018-082----), lying on another knoll 135m to NE. This writer concurs with the concluding observations of the ASI fieldworker who visited the site on 15/4/81: ‘The mound is quite low and rather insignificant. No real evidence that it is an antiquity... The precise nature of the mound is not clear’.   Enclosure: About 64m to S of mound is part of another curvilinear earthwork comprising an arc of broad bank 57m in length up to 5m in width, running from E to W, then veering to S, with a 2m-wide gap near the S end, on the S side of which another bank appears to run off to the NW. If this curving bank represents a segment of circular earthwork, the remainder of this continued under the road that runs alongside the field and into a ploughed field on the other side, where it appears to have been removed.

Although it looks similar to the single view published by R.A.S. Macalister and Ruby Murray (1931-2, PL. XII), its oblong shape would be unusual for an Early Bronze Age burial mound and Macalister gives his own measurements as 34ft 8in. (c. 10.6m) N-S and 37ft 10in. (c. 11.5m) E-W, suggesting that the elongated N and/or S sides of the tumulus have been trimmed by several metres since the early 1930s. Monument has been extensively damaged around edges by cattle in recent times, and this may partly account for its unusual shape, although it had apparently already been altered by Macalister and Murray's time—probably when an Ordnance Survey bench-mark was established on it: To the south and east there is an appearance suggesting a late spreading of the material, and it is highly probable that the summit was lowered by casting down some of the component stones and earth upon those sides, when the mound was adapted for the purposes of the survey. on the north sides the tumulus abuts on the boundary ditch and hedge of the field, and its sides are steeper and have a more original appearance (1931-2, 308).  The mound was excavated by Macalister and Murray with five labourers in a single day in 1931, and although 'restored' afterwards, there are no indications that they did anything but dig down from the upper surface, their trench being c. 3m in diameter. Underneath the 'superficial sods and grass, they found the mound to consist 'chiefly of small field stones ... [with] much earth between them'; in this matrix they found a cow's tooth and a single quartz pebble. About 0.76m below the summit they found three slabs resting on one another, underneath which was the capstone of a N-S oriented rectangular cist (0.63m x 0.36m). The E and W walls of the cist extended beyond the end wall on the S side, forming an extension paved with a single, neatly fitting slab, beyond which—outside the extension—was another rectangular paving-slab as wide as the whole cist (Fig. 5A); nothing was found under these slabs. On their sides at the NE and SE corners of the cist were two Early Bronze Age Food Vessels of the bowl tradition, one tripartite, the other ribbed. Throughout the fill of the cist, and to some extent above the capstone, were tiny scattered fragments of an unburnt human skeleton. Also found were bones of rat and frog and two jet beads. On account of the small size of the cist, the character of the human bones and the presence of animal bones, the excavators argued that a defleshed and disarticulated skeleton was reburied here (Macalister and Murray 1931-2; Waddell 1990, 151-4, Fig. 117; Ó Ríordáin and Waddell 1993, 141-2, Figs 213-214).

Height of mound above surrounding ground ranges from 3.3m on W side to 4.1m on E side. Given its size and location, this may be a passage-tomb, although it is uncertain whether it is composed primarily of earth or stone, and no kerbstones or other diagnostic features are visible.

Site has been greatly damaged by grazing cattle: four large chunks have   been removed up to a depth of 0.70m, two on E side and two on W side, showing the monument to be composed of earth with stones of various sizes, some very large.   On N and NW sides, mound appears to be in a slight hollow, as if its constituent material was scraped   from a broad ditch, 11m in width, curving around it.  Mound reaches a greatest height of 1.9m   on W side.   Although the mound is more likely to have had a domed profile originally, it might   possibly have been stepped, with a broad horizontal ledge surrounding a central cap; the damage, however, makes this very difficult to establish.

Monument presently covered with gorse, thorn and semi-mature trees on the summit.  The area is approached via a forest road which runs approx. 300m to the east of the site with mature spruce between the road and the monument. The monument consists of a very substantial earthen mound rising to a height of approx. 15m above the surrounding land, approx. 60m in diameter and roughly oval in shape. The mound is surrounded by mature spruce on all sides except the western half where recently planted ash trees are growing to within 10m of the monument. The summit of the mound is heavily covered by gorse, bramble and mature self-seeded trees. To the north of the mound there is evidence for possible quarrying where the mound has been partially dug away.  A buffer zone has been established around the monument in advance of clear felling.

Monument visited by ASI in 1980 and described as 'small disturbed bowl barrow' which consisted of 'a low circular mound of earth and stones, now much disturbed.  The mound is approx. 9m in diam. and now stands 1.25m high.  A number of small stones lie on the disturbed surface of the mound' (SMR File, 23/10/1980). In 2012 the monument was surveyed, re-classified as a mound-barrow and described as following: ‘Roughly circular and apparently flat-topped mound on low eminence with excellent views in all directions except to N, where higher ground rises a few fields away; ground drops away sharply to W and SW, but only slightly to N, E and SE.  Site is in a small, disused triangular patch of land at WNW edge of large field that has been heavily ploughed in recent years to within c. 2m of mound. This patch of land, overgrown with gorse and brambles close to the mound, is matted with long, thick, ungrazed grass, and part of the mound is covered by a pile of disused fencing and other rubbish, so that its edges and upper surface cannot be clearly seen or felt.  As such, its diameter and height can only be crudely estimated as 9m N?S x 8.5m E-W and up to 1.1m respectively, and, although there appears to be no ditch surrounding it, faint traces of one might not be currently discernible.

Seamus O'Brien). Ground level varies greatly around monument, so that its height ranges from 3.11m on SW side to 3.9m on NE side; ground falls away sharply to SE, making it difficult to distinguish between slope of mound and the natural slope, but it appears to have been highest on this side. Mound apparently had a rounded top originally, although there may have been a very small, flattened apex. The top has been dug into at some stage, possibly by treasure-hunters: an area c. 1.5m x c. 1.2m has been dug to a depth of c. 0.35m. There is some recent cattle-erosion around edges of mound, showing it to be composed of very stony earth. Various ledges or steps are also visible around its circumference, but none appears to run continuously around. While the clear steps on the Slane More barrows suggest the possibility that these ledges are original features, their irregular character and the smooth, elegant profile surviving on the SSW side strongly suggests that they are paths made by cattle climbing the mound or terraces resulting from soil-flow.  There is an old, overgrown quarry just N of mound. Mound at Colleen More (WM019-013----) is just visible to NE and Knockdrin (WM012-1183----) is very prominent to ENE’.

A circular shaped earth and stone mound (H 3m) the summit of which slopes gently from E-W (approx. top diam. 19m; approx. base diam 30m), enclosed by a wide, shallow fosse (approx. Wth 5m) visible at N and E only. This appears to be the 'Ancient Rath or Tumulus’ referred to by William Chapman in his letter of 1793 to Austin Cooper, in which a stone built chamber had been found with some bones inside (Price 1942, 125-7).  In 1792 the S side of the mound had been partially excavated by a local person who removed the top sod and exposed the cairn material covering the burial chamber or cist which appears to have been a wedge shaped chamber roughly aligned N-S which tapers to a point at the S end. The sides of the cist appear to consist of possibly 9 or 7 flagstones set on edge and roofed with flat lintels.  The mound was described in 1793 as covered with 'stones from the size of a Man's fist to about 5 times as large.  This was superinduced by a coat of gravel & earth of various thickness, but generally about 3 feet [0.91m].  The base of the Rath was about 90 yards [82m] in circumference, & its perpendicular Altitude about 30 feet [9.1m]' (ibid., 125).  According to Chapman the mound and stone cairn covered a cist constructed with flagstones which contained 'a few scattered bones amongst which was a thigh bone, which was only 15 ins. [38cm] long, from the best information I could obtain, 4 or 5 human skeletons were found, but their skulls & most of their bones were soon carried away by the people' (ibid.).  The stone material in the mound was used by local people in 1792 who at the time 'were building cottages at the North end of Castle Pollard to have recourse to the Rath as the cheapest and most convenient place for obtaining rubble stone' (ibid., 126).  During the course of these works the local people exposed the S end of the stone cist which was covered by the cairn material and one of the side-stones was removed enabling access to the interior of the cist which contained the skeletal material which was also removed from the chamber.  The cairn material subsided within a year of the disturbance covering the cist which was no longer accessible in 1793.  See attached profile of monument surveyed and drawn by the ASI.

According to Carrigan (1905, vol. 2, 201-2), 'about 60 or 70 yds. due west of Kilmocar church , there was a large cone-shaped moat or tumulus, which was removed about the year 1880. In the centre of the moat, on a level with the surrounding land, the workmen came upon an enclosure 4 or 5 ft. square, built of solid masonry, but with no covering slab; it was filled up with black earth and human bones'. Carrigan (ibid.) also states that Kilmacar castle stood midway between 'the moat and Kilmocar church'. It is unclear whether the castle stood on the 'moat' in which case the mound may have been a motte, or whether it was located near to, but not on it. The reference to what sounds like a cist (KK010-038007-) beneath the mound, suggests it was a barrow.

Monument is very prominently located on the highest point of a ridge or spur running ESE-WNW, forming N side of the Drumhurlin River valley, which levels out to E before rising up to another peak, but drops down quite steeply to W where there is another mound-barrow (WM013-112----) lower down 200m to W, beyond which the land falls again to W. The ridge drops very steeply a short distance to N and S of the present barrow; there is what appears to be a small-scale linear quarry on S side, on upper slope of ridge. Visibility is superb except to E, with a mound- or bowl-barrow (WM013-016----) visible 1.5km to SW on S side of the Drumhurlin River Valley; a second, unclassified-barrow (WM013-020----) across the valley 1.2km to S would be visible but for trees'.

Upper surface is difficult to examine but appears irregular and disturbed; a hollow in its SW side (3m x 2.8m) may be due to treasure-hunters, and a limestone flag (1.36m x 0.87m) at SW end of hollow, which rocks when pressure is applied and is hollow underneath, might possibly be part of a cist, presumably displaced by digging as was taken to be the case by an ASI fieldworker on 24/5/83, who noted this and a few other stones close by [SMR file]. Though barely visible now due to vegetation, the ASI also noted that ‘the sides have been dug into in several places notably on SW, NE and SE’ [SMR file]. Although identified as a bowl-barrow in the SMR file, there is no ditch surrounding this monument and it is best taken as a tumulus or mound-barrow.  This large, prominent barrow is located on a very low rise in flattish pasture, with best visibility to N.

The ASI account of 23/3/73 is given here:  [A] substantial broad earthen ring encompassing a saucer-shaped depression. The ring is continuous at present and there is no visible trace of an entrance way. No visible trace of a fosse. It is difficult to decide without excavation whether this was a circular ring originally or whether it was a mound which has been mutilated by digging down at the centre and throwing out the dug material. The site is completely overgrown with furze and briars. Sited on a very slight natural rise and surrounded by gently undulating land of average to good pasture. Part of a modern field bank has been built against the mound on the WNW. I prefer to regard this earthwork as a mutilated mound. [SMR file] Another, undated account questions its identification as a barrow: This may have been a mound which has been mutilated by digging down at the centre and throwing out the upcast.  It may also have been a not too ancient house-site altered by time so as to have the appearance of a mound. Note its proximity to the modern buildings. [SMR file]   By contrast, a third account makes an attempt to identify the monument within the broad Barrow class: This is a small roughly circular mound of earth. At its highest point the mound is about 2m in height. There is a wide circular depression on top of the mound. A field bank adjoins the mound on the western side.... This is presumably a disturbed bowl barrow. [SMR file] Given the absence of a ditch, the suggested classification of the monument as a bowl-barrow cannot be accepted; instead it would appear to be a ransacked mound-barrow.  Monument is in a low-lying, poorly drained location with quite poor visibility’.  Compiled by: Caimin O'Brien based on details provided by David McGuinness.  Date of upload: 8 February 2016",,,,,

Monument surveyed in 2015 and described by McGuinness (2015, 54) as following: ‘Dome-shaped tumulus, roughly circular (Diam. 13.8m NW-SE x 12.4m NE-SW) but poorly defined on ESE side, possibly due to slippage, and severely distorted by a mature ash on SSE side, the roots of which spread around and deeply into the mound, especially its S half; these roots to an extent help shore up the mound, which is intact above or upslope of the line of roots but severely eroded below this line. Height of mound above surrounding ground level ranges from 1.5m at SE to 1.75m at SW. W side of mound was densely overgrown at time of visit and could not be closely inspected.  The ASI account of 21/8/81 noted that ‘The perimeter at SE & the SW has been slightly damaged by digging in the past;’ the same account identified the monument as a bowl-barrow, but given that no mention is made of a perimeter ditch; that the ASI account of 13/9/73 specifically mentions that ‘There is no trace of a surrounding fosse’ [SMR file]; and that the present survey team observed no trace of any, the monument seems best classified as a mound-barrow.   Monument is prominently positioned in pasture on N side of low hill with best visibility to N, the ground dropping away sharply to NE but less so to NW and SE; the land to SW is of a similar height. About 250m to NE is a burial ground containing the ruined medieval parish church of Killulagh (WM013-057----)’.  See attached profile of monument surveyed and drawn by the ASI.

Monument described in 1977 as following; 'Not marked on current 6 inch [OS] map. A circular round topped mound of earth and stone. It is grass covered but where it is slightly defaced in places many stones are visible. These are about 20cms in diameter. There is no visible trace of a fosse. There is no visible trace of a kerb. Sited on the top of a prominent natural rise of gently undulating land of good pasture. Good views of surrounding countryside. The X marked by me on the current 6 inch [OS] map is the accurate site of the mound. Diameter from lower edge 9m. Height of mound 1.40m. Profile to be measured E-W’ (ASI Field Report 16/05/1977). A second report in 1981 described the monument as following; 'Situated on a prominent rise in gently undulating good pasture. Not marked on 6” sheet [OS map]. The site is a barrow of earth and stones partially denuded to reveal some of the stone particularly at the base perhaps where they may have formed a slight kerb. These stones measure 20-25cm in diameter and appear to be of local shale. The mound is round topped and grass covered, measuring 9m in diameter and rising to a height of 1.5m from the lower edge. Due to the undulating nature of the pasture and the erosion of the lower limits of the mound, it is difficult to say exactly where the edge of the barrow is especially on the North and East. There is no trace of an external fosse or bank [recorded as profiled but no measured profile in file]’ (ASI Field Report 21/08/1981).   Monument surveyed in 2015 and described by McGuinness (2015, 53-4) as following: ‘Monument appears to have been destroyed: nothing was visible to the present survey-team where it was clearly located by the ASI, and the land has been recently ploughed. Fortunately there are two descriptions of the site by different ASI fieldworkers. The ‘slight kerb’ of the second account must be treated with suspicion in view of the definitive statement to the contrary in the first account.

TIMOLIN, SITE 43 (designated KD036-047----) proper was a low mound, half of which was on the line of the road, but, as cist burials had previously been found on either side of the line of the road, it was decided to investigate the entire area (Licence No. 99E0203). The site of a slip road adjoining the present road was also investigated because a further cist grave was said to have been found at the foot of a standing stone near the present road. A geophysical survey of the relevant areas pinpointed a number of potential features, and eight cuttings, 2m x 2m, were dug by hand on the sites indicated. Only one of these showed any structural remains, and that appeared to be a recent feature, near the present road. However, a large amount of medieval pottery was found here in the topsoil. It may be significant that the Fair Green is recorded as having been near here. After the eight cuttings had been excavated, the relevant parts of the route were completely stripped by machine. Two small burnt spreads were found, as well as traces of drains and lazy-beds that had been shown in the geophysical survey. Further medieval pottery was found scattered around the field, presumably spread by ploughing. When Site 43 proper, a low circular mound, was being stripped, a pit burial (designated KD036-047001-) was exposed, and the remainder of the half of the mound to be affected by the road was excavated by hand. A further pit (designated KD036-047002-) and two cists (designated KD036-047003- and KD036-047004-) were found.The first pit, Feature 6, was subrectangular, 1.3m x 0.9m, and 0.2m deep. It contained the remains of a child, five to seven years old. The bones were not burnt but were broken and disarticulated. This appeared to be the result of later disturbance, as some of the bones were found between three overlapping flat stones that had collapsed into the pit. The second pit, Feature 8, was also subrectangular, 1.9m x 1.1m, but the lower part was smaller and almost triangular. The overall depth was 0.43m. Some flat slabs of stone were found near the top. This pit had certainly been disturbed, as only two fragments of cremated bone were found in it, along with part of a clay pipe stem. One cist, Feature 7, comprised four stone slabs forming the walls (1.2m x 0.8m) and a capstone that was somewhat bigger than the cist proper. There was no floor stone. It contained a crouched inhumation, with no grave-goods. The skeleton lay on its right, facing west, with the head at the southern end. It was identified as the remains of a woman aged 25-35. The second cist, Feature 9, was polygonal, with a stone base. No capstone was present, but there was an outer wall of slabs sloping inwards at an angle of about 30o. The cist was shallow, only 0.2-0.23m deep, and was filled with a mixture of soil and cremated bone. Cremated bone was also found beneath the floor stone and between the inner and outer walls. The cremation represented the remains of two adults and one child. They were accompanied by two pots: an upright vase and an undecorated vessel, inverted. The cist proper measured 1.4m x 0.86m; the overall dimensions including the outer walls were 1.6m x 1.4m. (www.excavations.ie)",,,,,

Otherwise the interior is featureless. Internal diameter of the site is 22.0m N-S by 17.5m E-W. It seems likely that the banks were constructed by scooping out the material from interior and piling it up to form the enclosing bank.'Compiled by Michael Connolly for the Archaeological Survey of Ireland as part of a survey of the Lee Valley area in 1996-97.Date of upload: 03 May 2012",,,,,

The field slopes down from the west to the east and north and is marshy in those areas at the base of the slope. The site affords good views to the east and north-east, while the low hill which is crowned by Glanbane hillfort is visible to the south – south-east. The embanked enclosure (KE039-202001-) shows up clearly on aerial photography and is situated in one of the marshy areas of the field. The site consists of a large, denuded bank, which can be traced all round the site. The bank is on average 9.5m wide, 0.57m high internally and 0.47m high externally. The site is partially scarped back into the natural slope of the ground at the north – north-west and this gives an exaggerated internal height (c. 1m ) at this point. There is no evidence for an entrance at any point. There appears to be evidence for an external ditch to the west – north-west but this is more than likely related to the possible barrow rather than the enclosure, as no definite ditch can be discerned elsewhere round the site. The interior is relatively flat at base but, due to the inward slope of the enclosing bank, the site would have a “saucer-like” profile. The interior is damp and has a heavy growth of irises. The internal dimensions of the site are 22.7m N-S and 21.5m E-W.

Large circular area (approx. diam. 35m) enclosed by a heather covered drystone wall (H 0.7m; T 0.7m) with low roughly rectangular shaped flat-topped drystone cairn (DG096-031001-) or leacht type feature located in the centre of the waterlogged interior. Local tradition asserts that this was the burial site of warriors killed in an ancient battle (pers. comm. S O'Beirne). The interior of this enclosure is very unusual in that it is very wet and marshy. The presence of so much sphagnum, which sinks down quite considerably as one walks over the surface, suggest that the original surface of the interior was much lower than the present level. It is possible that the interior of this site was slighly hollow or concave and that the field drains taking water from the mountain slope directly behind the monument have since blocked up causing the interior of this monument to become waterlogged in more recent times. There is evidence of an inner bank of earth and stone visible in the E quadrant of the interior, this feature does not fully enclose the interior. From higher ground the presence of the low cairn or leacht in the centre, the waterlogged interior, the hollow amphitheatre like location and the double enclosing feature and the possibility that the interior was once hollow or slightly concave gives the monument the appearance of a burial monument such as a possible pond barrow or some other form of unknown ritual type monument.

Surveyed in 2013 and described by McGuinness (2014, 51) as following: 'Subcircular enclosure delimited by a broad, low bank  (Diam.  22.7m N-S x  25.5m E-W) surrounding a hollowed-out area roughly centred on an enormous, fragmentary limestone boulder (H. c. 4.5m) known as the ‘Catstone’, which is 3.7m from the bank where this is closest on SW side; interior reaches below external ground level and has presumably been excavated to gather material for the bank, and possibly to expose the lower part of the Catstone, as was suggested to Borlase by a local labourer. Monument is located in rough pastureland that slopes down steeply from NE to SW, the slope including both surrounding bank and hollowed interior. Bank ranges from 4.4m to 4.6m in width and reaches up to 1.36m above interior ground-level immediately inside high E side; although on SE side, where bank is prominent, it rises 2.1m above that part of interior immediately adjacent to Catstone; bank reaches up to  0.54m in height above external ground level but may be higher on overgrown S side, where ground falls away sharply.   This is the ‘Catstone’, a recent name derived from its supposed appearance. A cylindrical hole visible in the top of the central boulder was clearly intended to support the flag-pole which Macalister and Praeger say was erected on it in its capacity as a recent ‘centre for political and other meetings’. For the historical and mythic significance of this ancient and important monument marking the traditional centre of Ireland, and named variously as Aill na Mireann or ‘Rock of the Divisions’, Petram Coithrigi (Tírechán) and Umbilicus Hiberniæ (Giraldus Cambrensis), see Macalister and Praeger (1928, 78-80) and Schot (2006, 40-41).  Dr Cyril Fox, director of the National Museum of Wales, who assisted with the Uisneach excavations, suggested to Macalister and Praeger that the embanked enclosure ‘might have been added to the Catstone stone in order to produce an artificial resemblance to an umbilicus, thus linking the boulder to the Omphalos cult at Delphi and elsewhere’ (Macalister and Praeger 1928, 78). Certainly, as Schot demonstrates with an aerial photograph, it has the appearance of a navel from the air. Among early references to the site, Tírechán in his seventh-century Life of St. Patrick claims that the saint was here with ‘pilgrims’ (peregrini), apparently with the intention of founding a church, and that he met one of the sons of the progenitor of the Cenél Fiachach, Fíachu mac Néill, at the sone. In the Tripartite Life the saint actually founds a monastery at Uisneach: Macalister and Praeger suggest a ringfort c. 200m to SE (WM024-069----) as the site of the saint’s foundation. There are references in Camden to a Bishopric ‘of Meath or Elnamirand [Aill na Mireann]’ (Macalister and Praeger 1928, 78-80; Herity 2011, 81; Bieler 1979, 136-7).

Although, as with the closely similar monument at Clonydonnin (No. 6), outer edge of bank blends almost seamlessly with external ground level, it is clearest and best preserved at SSE where its width and height over external ground level can be estimated as 2.5m and 0.37m respectively; and while the same ambiguity prevents an accurate depth measurement of the interior with reference to external ground level, it certainly has the appearance of falling below ground level. Near the centre of the monument is a large, overgrown and apparently earthfast boulder (L. 1.05m; W. 0.70m; H. 0.35m).

M'Elligott, a farmer in that neighbourhood, was employed with some workmen in widening the old road which passes near the gallaun [KE020-020001-]. In the course of his work, within about 3 feet [0.9m] of the rut of the old road, and about 2 feet [0.6m] below the surface, he found some small and thin flags of limestone, on removing which he found they covered a grave or tomb [KE020-020003-] lined at the sides with flags of the same kind as those covering it.  The grave was about 2 feet [0.6m] wide, and as far as he examined it about 2 feet [0.6m] long, lying east and west.  The grave lay within about 80 yards [73m] of the conspicuous gallaun or pillar stone [KE020-020001-] which crowns the highest point of the limestone ridge that runs east and west for some miles through the plains of Clanmaurice.  The townland around the gallaun is known as Ardconnel (the height of Conal), and I have no doubt that this Ardconnel is the very ancient Ardconail mentioned in the ""Book of Rights"" as the site of one of the Portaibh or Royal seats of the Kings of Cashel. This pillar stone, which is a very remarkable one, visible from every point of the compass for many miles, consists of a block of whinstone, 8 feet [2.4m] high over the present surface, about 3 feet [0.9m] broad, and 15 inches [0.4m] thick, must have been brought from the cliffs near Kerry Head, about 9 miles distant, where stones of that kind are found in large quantities. This may have been the monumental stone of the illustrious chief Conal, whose name is thus preserved by the townland designation, but of whose name and fame history and legend are silent.

To minimise further destruction, Trench 1 (19.2m long in total) was dug from 3m to the north of the site, through the pit to the north and southwards through the centre ofthe site, with a dog-leg to the west to avoid the second pit, as it was found that the stratigraphy was too disturbed in these areas to be of archaeological use. The main feature noted was the fosse, 1.7m wide and at least 0.84m deep. It was not bottomed as this was merely a test excavation to confirm the presence of the monument. Much charcoal was present in the layers investigated but there were no finds. Apart from two possible areas of burning within the monument, there were no other features noted in this trench. Trench 2 ran for 37m in a north-west/south-east direction to the north east of the site. Another possible area of burning or perhaps the base of a small pit was found in the trench, and a narrow U-bottomed fosse/ditch, 0.8m wide and 0.75m deep, was also sectioned.

This enclosure is indicated on the 1838 OS 6-inch as a roughly circular feature outlined by a dashed line, with trees indicated in the interior; on the 1930 edition it is outlined with a solid line, with trees depicted in the interior. Circular area (17m E?W; 19m N?S) with a sunken interior defined by a slightly raised rim with an external fosse on the N arc. Constructed on sloping ground, the sunken interior slopes steeply from W down to E, with a drop of 1.6m from the perimeter at W to the centre, where the ground gently levels out. The perimeter has a hint of a raised rim but it does not constitute a clearly defined ‘bank’. It has a low external scarp, which is pronounced (ext. H 0.7m) only on the downslope S arc, but is almost flush (max. ext. H 0.2m) with exterior ground level on the upslope W arc; and it drops directly into the fosse on the N arc. There is a slightly raised internal lip (Wth 1-2m) on the downslope E arc, but elsewhere there is no clearly defined internal edge, instead the perimeter merges seamlessly with the steep slope of the sunken interior. The fosse is evident NW?NE as a very shallow depression (Wth 2m; ext. D 0.2m); it cannot be traced elsewhere around the circuit. Five mature ash trees, a beech tree and two hawthorn trees grow around the perimeter. There is a dense growth of nettles in the interior.  The nature of this enclosure is uncertain. Lavelle (1994, 9, no. 42) classified it as a ringbarrow and mistook it as the find spot of two excavated cists (MA100-056----; MA100-056001-). In fact, the cists were found c. 30m to N (Movius 1934, 72, fig. 1). It may be the remains of a ringbarrow, the interior of which has been disturbed or quarried out. Another possibility is that it is some form of estate feature or tree-ring.

A ring-barrow partially excavated by the Irish Fieldschool of Prehistoric Archeology (NUIG) in 2018 (Ó Maoldúin 2020). Excavation revealed a sequence of activity stretching from the Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age to the modern day. The Chalcolithic/EBA activity identified was funerary in nature, comprising depositions of small deposits of cremated bone accompanied by artefacts including a small white flint barbed and tanged arrowhead. Four white flint flakes were also found on the barrow possibly representing one knapping episode. The excavation of the barrow ditch may have contributed to the raising of the interior however the majority of upcast material appears to have been used to construct the external bank. A standing stone was erected centrally at some point. Prior to excavation just a small portion protruded above the grass. More cremation deposits were placed around this, apparently as late as the 6th-9th century AD. Other activity that occurred on the barrow during this time appears to have included feasting and possible glass bead production. Radiocarbon dates will follow to determine the sequence of fills in the ditch and the activity in the centre of the barrow.  Compiled by: Mary Tunney  Date of upload: 13 October 2020",,,,,

There are excellent views of the surrounding countryside, with the Ox Mountains dominating the skyline to E and SE.  This ringbarrow is not shown on the 1837-8 and the 1922 OS 6-inch maps. It consists of a low, circular platform (6m N-S; 5.5m E-W; H 0.6m) enclosed by a well-defined fosse (Wth 2.2; ext. D 0.95m) and remnants of an external bank. The bank has been largely levelled; a slight rise is still evident in parts, but it is evident mainly as a cropmark (Wth 1.6m). The central platform appears to be earthen, composed of fine sandy soil. A concentration of boulders occupies most of the platform. The largest boulder (H 1.2m; circ. 4.45m) is slightly off-centre to S. It occupies a shallow depression and appears to rest on a number of smaller stones. Adjacent to the NE, is a narrow, recumbent stone (L 1.3m; Wth 0.4m), oval in cross-section. To N of this, is an upright boulder (H 1.05m; circ. 2.4m), which appears to be set in the ground. Several smaller stones are scattered over the surface. The haphazard arrangement of the boulders and stones suggests that some, at least, are the result of field clearance. The depth and sharp definition of the fosse contrasts with the degraded nature of the bank, and may be result of modern activity; OPW field notes record a number of channels or drains cutting through the bank (SMR file). The ringbarrow was enclosed within a rectilinear enclosure (c. 33m E?W; c. 22m N?S), defined by a field bank. This enclosure is shown on the 1922 OS 6-inch map, although the barrow is not.

Described as a ‘true mote’ by Westropp (1900-02, 446), named ‘Cregnakeeroge Fort (Mound of Magh Adhair)’ on the 1921 OS 6-inch map, listed as ‘Enclosure’ in the SMR (1992) and the RMP (1996) and noted as a possible barrow by Condit and Grogan (2000, 23-4). Herity (1993, 144) remarks that the archaeological evidence at Magh Adhair places it with little doubt in the prehistoric period. The true nature of the mound is unknown as it remains unexcavated but its use as an inauguration site (CL034-095007-) is well documented. A subcircular grass and scrub-covered mound (dims. of top 26m N-S; 22m E-W; base 37m N-S; H 3.1m at S to 5.5m at N) which is flat-topped, but sloping down to the S (H 1.3m). A stone revetment (H 0.1-0.3m) lines the top edge externally N-ESE. The mound is surrounded by a fosse (Wth of top 7m; Wth of base 2.8-3.3m) with an outer bank of earth and stone (Wth 4-8m; int. H 0.5-1.5m; ext. H 0.5-1.5m). A causeway (Wth 5m; H 1-1.4m) of earth flanked with stone facing crosses the fosse at SW. A stone-lined bank at N (L 1.2m) with stone facing at W (H 1m) may represent a second causeway across the fosse. Condit and O’Sullivan (1998) note that the flat top and possible entrance features are likely to be medieval modifications to the probable original Bronze Age burial mound. This is one of a number of monuments in the immediate area dating from prehistory to the medieval period. A cairn (CL034-095004-) lies 7m to the W, a bullaun stone (CL034-095003-) with quartzite inclusions lies 27m to the NW and a standing stone (CL034-095005-) is 70m to the W. A rath (CL034-095008-) is 36m to NW with a conjoined D-shaped enclosure (CL034-095009-) and a number of field boundaries (CL034-095010-) are visible c. 7m N of these enclosures (visible on Google Earth satellite image taken 5 February 2009, accessed 4 March 2015).  Grogan and Condit (2000, 23-4) note both the barrow-like morphology and the presence of the stone with quartzite inclusions to the NW. They cite barrows at Glennagross (CL052-064003-) and Carrownanelly (CL042-004001-) in the same region that also have small standing stones with quartzite inclusions close to the perimeter of their outer banks.

Excavated by MacDermott and described as following; The sites, which consisted of a level space enclosed by a shallow ditch and a very slight outer bank (only discernible in places), were approximately of equal size 6 metres in diameter from outside of ditch to outside ofditch. Their centres were 10 metres apart. Before excavation the ditch of Site I (the southern barrow) was most clearly marked at the south side and traces of an outer bank were discernible at the south and south-east, rising up at the south-east towards the edge of a modern field-ditch which bordered on the sites at this side. The outer bank was again visible at the northwhere the ground rose and fell again to leave a slight depression between Sites I and II. Outside the barrows, to the east, the ground sloped towards a depression caused by an ancient river bed which could be also traced round the south of Barrow I.  On excavation it was seen that the soil conditions on these sites were similar to those at Ballingoola III and IV a tenaciousyellow clay underlay the humus everywhere except in the western half of Site I where boulder clay appeared. The ditches were cut into the clay to a depth of approximately 48cm. They had evidently filled or been filled very rapidly because the fill was practically indistinguishable from the undisturbed clay, but their outline was clearly marked in the sections by a dark humus band. The slight outer bank could not be seen in all the sections but in some places appeared clearly as a thin spread over the old turf line. There were no traces of any structure or grave remainsin either barrow.  Scatters of charcoal and burnt stone appeared near the centre in all quadrants of Site I. In the south-east quadrant were two dark hollows, approximate depth 35 cm., containing much charcoal and burnt stone.  Some small fragments of coarse gritty pottery came from the hollow at the south. Trenches were cut through these hollows to determine the relationship between them and the ditch and it was revealed that the ditch had been cut into the burnt material which therefore ante-dated the barrow.

A circular flat-topped mound (diam. 12.6m at base, 8m at top) surrounded by a fosse (Wth 2.4m at base) and an external earth and stone bank (Wth 5.6m; int. H 1.05m; ext. H 0.3m). The mound rises 1.35m above the base of the fosse. Recorded in 1836 as 'Sídheán a'Gháire' (OSL, 423), a translation of which was given in Wood-Martin (1887-8, 269) as 'the Fairy Mount of Laughter'. A bowl-barrow (SL033-050----) lies c. 50m to WSW.  The above description is derived from the published 'Archaeological Inventory of County Sligo' compiled by Ursula Egan, Elizabeth Byrne, Mary Sleeman with Sheila Ronan and Connie Murphy (Dublin Stationery Office, 2005).   This ring-barrow was severely damaged by land reclamation work in April 2006: the enclosing bank was levelled, the fosse infilled and several pits dug through the central mound. A rescue excavation (06E0720) was undertaken over three weeks in August 2006 by Margaret Keane, National Monuments Service (Keane 2009, 469, no. 1770). The excavation concentrated on the western side of the crest of the mound, and in addition a single trench was excavated across the fosse and external bank. The excavation of the fosse revealed that it was originally c. 2.5m wide at the top and c. 0.9m deep, with a sharply cut external edge, a rounded base, and a shallower profile on the internal mound side. A single post-hole was recorded just inside the edge of the mound crest. On the crest of the mound, the upper deposits consisted of spreads of charcoal-rich soils, with burnt bone and occasional artefacts interleaving with a spread of compact white/grey silt. Burnt material spread across the site may represent rakings of funeral pyre material. Beneath these layers, were a cluster of eight pits (max. dims. 0.3-1.3m) filled with deposits of burnt bone, in a clayey matrix with occasional artefacts. The interior edges of some of the pits were significantly charred. The most impressive pit (D c. 0.5m) had a basal deposit of cremated bone, and upper fills rich in charcoal and burnt bone. Artefacts recovered include ten glass beads or bead fragments, two unperforated glass beads/toggles, a single copper alloy spiral ring, five copper alloy pins, a copper alloy rod, copper alloy fragments, iron fragments, pieces of slag, worked flint and chert.

CARROWMORE (Carbury By.),SLIGO,SL014-114----,SL01556,120101,RGBA,ring-barrow,54.25591,-8.512639,"Timoney (1984, 323, no. 12) describes this as follows: ‘The total diameter of this ring-barrow, sited on low ground, is 16.30 m. It consists of a circular mound, 5.50m in diameter and 40cm high, surrounded by a ""U""-bottomed fosse, 1.50m wide and 30cm deep, and by a bank, 2m wide and 60cm high. Petrie (1837; Stokes 1868, 245) in dealing with the megalithic remains at Carrowmore refers to this as follows: ""This circle which is situated near the road, and eastnortheast of no. 9, is composed of small stones mixed with earth and is forty feet in diameter. There is a stone sepulchre in the center but no cromlcach"". Since then it has consistently been classified as a megalithic tomb. Wood-Martin (1888, p. 15, fig. 1) marked this monument on his map as no. 12 and restated Petrie's description of it. Following them Borlase (1897, 151), who completely misinterprets Wood-Martin's plan of the monument, Herity (1974. 266) and Kitchen (1983, 161) all have sought to explain this monument as the remains of a megalithic tomb. If Pertie's no. 12 be equatable with the monument described above, and there seems to be no cartographic or literary reason to do otherwise, then the interpretation of this monument as being the remains of a megalithic tomb are unwarranted. Burenhult (1980:1, 93) lists this not as a megalith, but as Structure 3, Carrowmore.’ (Bergh 1995, 186, Carrowmore 12)  This is a National Monument in State care (No. 153).

Prior to investigation, a depression in the bank at N was thought to indicate an entrance, however on excavation, there was no evidence to support this (ibid). Excavation did prove that the fosse had been excavated to a depth of 0.5m.  There was no trace of any burials, pits, post-holes or other signs of activity. Toward the centre of the mound, there was a slight flecking of charcoal containing some charred seeds (ibid). Excavation has dated the mound to the Neolithic period based on a piece of pottery of Windmill Hill type. Other finds include an unfinished chert arrowhead, a flake of greenstone axe and a few pieces of chert and flint debitage (ibid).

Around the base of the mound is the innermost fosse (Wth 4.5m) which is silted up and marked by a dense growth of rushes. Outside this fosse is the intervening bank (Wth c. 3m; int. H 0.25m; ext. H 0.5m) which is in turn surrounded by another fosse (Wth 4.8m) evident as a broad wet depression marked by rushes. The external bank (Wth 5m; int. H 0.35m; ext. H 0.5m) is evident as a broad low flattened grass-covered rise, except SW-W where it has been removed.

Excavation revealed circular 'very low mound' (diam. 52ft) enclosed by 'round bottomed' fosse (D 1ft; Wth 3ft). This overlay pits, stake-holes, charcoal spreads and fragments of a human skull and 'produced a range of pottery types which date the monument to the Neolithic period' (ibid.); subsequent activity on site of three more phases interpreted as follows: multiple cist cairn (CO027-069---) placed on mound of ringbarrow and within fosse; food vessel burial (CO027-161---) outside fosse; urn burial (CO027-260---) also outside fosse, which was extended to enclose burial. This sequence recently questioned in light of two radiocarbon dates from the site and reclassification of 'Neolithic' pottery as Beaker pottery (Brindley et al., 1987/8, 13-20). Three phases suggested: short term settlement with beaker pottery, pits etc.; multiple cist cairn with food vessel burial to SW; cist reused and cairn modified by enclosing it with fosse, which soon after was extended to enclose urn burial.

A geophysical survey (11R0074) of possible routes for a re-directed section of the N60 at Oran identified a number of possible enclosures defined by ditches (Gimson and Regan 2011). Archaeological testing (11E0247) disproved many of the anomalies, but a group of four features in Field 2 proved to be archaeological, and elements of the field system (RO034-081003-) may extend into this area (OHara 2011, 5-6, 24-5).  Only the S half of this enclosure was excavated (E004887). It is a circular area (int. diam. c. 24.5m; ext. diam. c. 32m) defined by a continuous V-shaped ditch (max. Wth of top 5.25m; max. D 1.8m) that was never re-cut and had no obvious entrance feature, although a widening of the fosse at W suggests there may be one at NW. A small quantity of animal bones from the ditch, acquired during the testing, provide a C14 date of 170 cal. BC   4 cal. AD. Although there was no evidence of an outer bank, it is postulated that one was present from the slip-lines in the ditch, and to occupy the space between it and the ring-ditch (RO034-112004-), 5m to the S.  A pit burial (diam. 0.68m; D 0.24m) containing a fill of burnt clay and charcoal beneath a deposit of burnt bone was off-centre in the interior, with a smaller spread beside it. The pit was topped with a final layer of silty clay with charcoal and burnt bone. No artefacts were recovered from the pit-burial, but it returned a C14 date of 1191-924 cal. BC, proving it to be unrelated to the enclosing ditch. Eight pieces of chert, a polishing stone and an iron object were recovered from the base of the ditch. Three phases are recognised in the ditch fill with silt present at the base. Charcoal spreads were present at the bottom as well as the articulated remains of a person with outstretched arms and the severed left foot placed between the legs. A second fill is a brown silty clay probably derived from an outer bank. A third phase was represented by a brown silty clay with charcoal concentrations which was sealed by a thin brown soil thought to be a humus. A charcoal spread E of the enclosure, and a curving slot-trench (Wth 0.5m; D 0.38m; L 5.8m plus) just to the NW cannot be stratigraphically linked with what is probably a barrow but all are probably contemporary. All the features were truncated by post-medieval furrows and a field ditch ran N-S just E of the barrows fosse.

Each about 2 feet [0.6m] in length and consisted of a circular part, 6-inches in diameter, and a long narrow portion about 3-inches [0.07m] in width, this latter part being filled with material somewhat lighter in colour because less humified. The maximum depth of these pockets was only 2½-inches [0.06m]. Their purpose is not clear; one might suggest their having contained deposits of cremated remains that had been completely dissolved by soil-acids, but this is only surmise (ibid. 184). No surface trace now visible at ground level.  Compiled by: Jean Farrelly  Date of revised upload: 14 October 2015",,,,,

The site was subsequently excavated between 27 June and 12 July 2006. This site consisted of a ring-barrow located near the brow of a gradual north-west-facing slope. There was one cremation burial centrally placed in the barrow and at least four token deposits of cremated bone were found in the fill of the ditch. This site enclosed an area 7m in diameter. The ditch was U-shaped in profile, with gradually sloping sides and a concave base. It had a maximum depth of 0.43m. The western extent of the ring-ditch was truncated and the ditch only survived to a depth of 0.15m.  This site was located c. 550600m to the east of two fulachta fiadh (Site 4602A2, see No. 1244 above, E2339; and Site 4705, see No. 1242 above, E2306) and 80m to the east of an enclosure site with a possible industrial function (see No. 1283 below, Site 47001B, E2342) (Excavations 2006 Site No. 1282; McQuade; Molloy & Moriarty 2009, 163-5).",,,,,

A large roughly circular area (overall diam. c. 75m E-W; int. diam. c. 30m E-W) delimited by a wide shallow flat-bottomed fosse with a substantial earth and stone bank well preserved from S-W-N-NE but elsewhere it is lower in height and has been defaced in places.  There is a modern gap in bank at NE and some old quarry holes at WNW and WSW.  The interior of the monument along with the enclosing fosse is traversed by old cultivation ridges running N-S.  Most of the interior of the monument has been disturbed by these cultivation ridges.    An old ESB pole has been placed on top of the bank at NE.  It has been suggested that this monument may be the remains of a possible henge due to the large diameter of the monument or may be an example of a large ring-barrow (SMR File 29/03/1973).

The 1971 account, identifying it as a ring-barrow, is as follows: A small, low, approx circular flat-topped area surrounded by remains of a well defined earthen bank with an internal wide shallow fosse. From SW-W-NW the bank and a small part of the fosse have been quarried away. A sectional profile of the perimeter of the site is visible in the resulting almost straight and almost vertical quarry face. Modern fences contact the outside of the bank on the NE and SE and between those two points the outer face of the bank has been steepened to form part of a boundary. It is overgrown with thorn trees there now. A gap in the bank on the N is probably a later feature due to disturbance. Sited on a small natural rise and surrounded by gently undulating land of poor to average pasture. Good views to the W and N. N-S diameter from top of bank = 22.20m.

Excavation results suggest that activity took place here during a number of periods and that the medieval enclosure is actually located on the site of an earlier monument. Within the internal flat platform of the large medieval enclosure were: the remains of a possible Bronze Age ring-barrow (OF002-021001-), possible associated post-holes and a stone-lined cist; possible medieval industrial pits with an associated rectangular structure; and numerous post-medieval cultivation furrows and isolated pits. The site phasing has been divided as follows. Prehistory A circular enclosure c. 14m in diameter was identified at the top of a natural gradual slope. This consisted of an enclosing ditch c. 2m wide and 1m deep. Within this was a smaller enclosing ditch c. 7m in diameter, 0.4m wide and 0.2m deep. It is felt that this may have represented the site of a possible Bronze Age barrow. The barrow was subsequently partially recut during medieval times to accommodate a large industrial furnace (OF002-021002-) with an associated area of stone metalling. Part of a human skull was found with the lower fills of the barrow. This bone may have been disturbed by the later activity in the vicinity, therefore its association with the barrow is unclear. To the north of these features was a stone-lined cist (OF002-021003-) that appeared to contain a disturbed cremation. A number of post-holes were identified between the cist and the possible barrow, although no definitive pattern has been determined. Medieval It is felt that the main enclosure  which is best described as subrectangular  was probably of medieval date. There appears to have been a subsequent phase of possible medieval industrial activity, particularly in the east of the enclosure. This includes the previously mentioned furnace and stone metalled surface. The material excavated from here was charcoal-rich and contained a considerable amount of burnt human and animal bone, nineteen amber beads and small amounts of metal and slag. A number of pits that appeared to have functioned as furnaces were identified to the east and north of the barrow recut, although only trace amounts of slag were recovered. Further analysis of samples from these features will be required to determine the precise nature of the activity. The pits were subsequently backfilled with stone/rubble, suggesting that there may have been some contemporary clearance on the site. A collection of post-holes and three hearths in the south of the site may have formed 1 or 2 possible structures, cutting the bank material, and are also thought to be broadly contemporary with the industrial pits. However, these structures nor the pits did not appear to be of a large enough scale to be contemporary with the original enclosure. An abundance of charred seed remains were recovered from these hearths, as well as from other features on the site, which will provide a more definitive chronology of activity at the site. Post-medieval The north-west area of the enclosure contained a number of probable plough furrows. These curved slightly following the line of a slightly deeper probable boundary that extended from the entrance in the north of the enclosure to the south-east/east. Other isolated features of possible post-medieval date were identified across the site. It seems ",,,,,

Surveyed in 2013 and described by McGuinness (2014, 65) as following: 'Tiny, roughly circular mound  (Diam.  3.2m N-S x  3.5m E-W) surrounded by a ditch, with an overall diameter of 7.8m (NS and EW). Traces of a bank are currently visible outside the ditch on S side, but Macalister and Praeger, who excavated and made a sketch-plan and profile of the monument, clearly document this bank all around the perimeter. Large limestone boulders protrude from the mound and, most noticeably on W side, from the outside of the ditch; these are shown to be part of the bank on Macalister and Praegers plan. To NW of mound a boulder appears to lie in the ditch. Ditch ranges from 1.7m to 2.3m in width, being widest on W side, and is up to 0.49m in depth below external ground level on deepest S side; mound rises up to 0.49m above ditch on N side. The author concurs with Schot (2006) in identifying this site as a ring-barrow. Macalister and Praeger aptly compared it to the ring-barrow at Grannagh, Co. Galway. They trenched across the mound but found absolutely no trace of interments or of any other deposits, although the disposition of the stones inside the mound was not unsuggestive of a roughly constructed grave; no account of the excavation was providedwhere they dug their trench, whether they accurately reconstructed the monument afterwards, etc.although their sketch-plan appears to show these central stones.

Monument comprised a low central platform (basal diam. 17.6m N-S) surrounded by a broad flat-bottomed ditch, 2.5-4m in width, and an outer bank, 4-4.5m width from base of ditch to ground level outside.  Platform rises from 0.48m above base of ditch on E side up to 0.94m above base of ditch on SW side.  E side of platform appears flattened as if partly shorn off, and the adjacent ditch is wider here; this alteration appears to be related to a semicircular earthwork that adjoins NE side.  Where bank is well-preserved on NNE side it rises up to 1.3m above base of ditch, although on SW side, where it is fairly well preserved, it rises only 0.6m above base of ditch; where  bank is very low on E side, it nonetheless rises up to 1.7m above base of ditch.  Maximum height of bank above external ground level reaches 1m on WSW side.  Maximum depth of ditch below and perpendicular to a line joining top of bank to upper surface of platform ranges from 0.57m at SSE side to 0.96m at E side.

Running approximately in a semicircle from NE side of the present monument around N side of the bow-barrow, at a distance of no less than 10m from the latter, is a complex earthwork that appears to have been intended to link both monuments together.  This earthwork is closely connected with the ring-barrow and either forms part of its original design or, when constructed, necessitated significant alterations to the pre-existing barrow.  Bank of ring-barrow has been cut through on NE side by a low, V-shaped ditch, 7-7.5m wide, which joins onto ditch of ring-barrow 0.8m above its base.  Where this broad ditch joins onto ditch of barrow, the latter continues its curve and appears to have been widened at the expense of the central platform, which has had its E side shorn off and flattened.  On N side of ditch of semicircular earthwork is a low, flat-topped bank 2.5m in width and 0.45m in height, which runs for 40m into the next field, where it ends 12m to NW of the bowl-barrow (WM011-131----); opposite side of the ditch appears to be formed by scarping the slightly higher ground to SE.  At point where bank ends to NW of bowl-barrow (WM011-131----) it curves in towards scarp, gently narrowing the ditch.  From this point onwards, ditch below scarp is far narrower, being 4.5m across and 1m deep to N of bowl-barrow (WM011-131----), and there are only slight traces of a counterscarp bank beyond it; it runs in an ESE direction for 35m, where, about 16m ENE of the bowl-barrow, it ends, while the scarp itself kinks to E, running for another 17m before swerving to ",,,,,

Monument is mostly well preserved, although parts of outer bank have been removed, and except for SW and NE sides, its perimeter is covered by trees and bushes.  Monument comprises a central, steep-sided platform with flattish to slightly convex upper surface, surrounded by a ditch, from 4-4.5m in width and mostly flat-bottomed except where mound and bank have partly slipped in on N side; and an outer bank, ranging from 6-7.5m in width where best preserved at N, NE and  SW.   On N side, bank rises 0.8m above external ground level and 2m above base of ditch.  At E, W and SW, stretches of outer bank 1m, 6m and 5.5m in length respectively have been removed or severely damaged; the bank is also quite poorly preserved for an arc of 12m on SE side, and parts of its outer edge on N and S sides have been shorn off  by passing farm vehicles.   At the damaged SW part, the bank  has been much reduced in size and, for 0.7m, entirely breached; and about 2.5m to W of this gap the bank bulges  both inside and out, by as much as 4m on outer, SW side and reaches its greatest width (8.5m) and height above external ground level (1.1m). This bulge, much larger than the adjoining, well-preserved stretch of bank on same (SW) side of monument and apparently not original, may be composed of spoil from damaged bank to E.

Monument has been shaped from the top of a natural hillock, so that central mound is slightly higher than parts of inner bank, ground slopes down on all sides except NW, and outer ditch is appreciably lower than inner one except on NW side; nonetheless, despite the difference in height of natural ground on NW and SE sides, the overall impression is that the monument has been deliberately made to appear level from lower ground to E. Mound rises up to 0.36m above inner ditch. Inner bank is up to 3.5m in width where well preserved and rises up to 0.17m in height above inner ditch and, where highest by far on SE side, rises up to 0.83m above outer ditch. Inner and outer ditches are up to 2.8m and 3m in width respectively. On SW side, which may have been disturbed in the past by grazing animals, the distinction between central mound, inner ditch and bank is difficult to discern. Overall diameter measurements for the monument given above have been taken between the outer edges of the outer ditchhowever, in addition to the outer bank evident on part of the perimeter, there is a step or berm running around much of the circumference beyond the outer ditch, which appears to be natural, but which clearly enhances the overall appearance of the earthwork; and in the NE quadrant there appears to be a gap in the outer ditch as there is no distinction between it and the surrounding ground.   Monument is prominently sited on glacial hillock in pastureland between the arms of a Y-junction at Ballina where the important R390 road leading WSW from Mullingar diverges, the R390 continuing W past Uisneach (9km to W) and on to Athlone, and the R391 heading SW, as with the now-disused railway line.

Monument comprises a central mound (base diam. 11.3m N-S x 10m E-W) surrounded by a flat-bottomed ditch, 2.7-3.2m in width, and a very stony outer bank, 3.5-4m in width from base of ditch to ground level outside. On S side is an irregularly shaped gap in the bank 5m in length, apparently due to later disturbance. Central mound, which appears to be raised slightly above level of surrounding ground, rises up to 1.5m above base of ditch on E side, being higher on N and E sides than S and W sides. Bank rises up to 1.4m above base of ditch on W side, being higher on S and W sides than N and E sides. Maximum depth of ditch below and perpendicular to a line joining top of bank to upper surface of platform is 0.95m, and the distribution of such depths (N: 95cm; S: 85cm; E: 94cm; W: 95cm) indicates a fairly uniform depth around its circumference.  Running SW from W side of barrow is a scarp or possibly a low bank 1.5m wide, the ground to NW of it being lower than that to SE; at 15.5m from the barrow it kinks to SSE, running as a scarp for another 10.5m to another barrow on summit of hill (WM018-085003-) 20m to WSW of ring-barrow. Running E from this mound in a very gently S-curving line for 20m is another low scarp, the ground to S being 0.3m lower than that to N and dropping down quite steeply. E end of this scarp is 7m SW of ring-barrow. These two scarps or low banks are identified as an 'Enclosure' in RMP (WM018-085002-), and although the second scarp does not join onto the ring-barrow, the overall effect is that the flattish summit of this low hill has been defined by a scarp, linking the mound at highest part of hill to the ring-barrow on slope of hill to ENE.

Although it could not be located on 26/7/79 due to high grass, it has been described on two subsequent occasions by different ASI fieldworkers. The account of 7/4/81: A small circular earthwork outlined by a shallow circular fosse enclosing a level interior. There is no indication of a bank. The site slopes very slightly from NE-SW. The area around the site is crossed by old cultivation ridges running NE-SW, & the site has been somewhat defaced by these. It is likely that any trace of a bank would have been removed by the cultivation. Sited on the top of a large prominent natural ridge running NW-SE. The ridge has a broad flat top. Located in pasture land with other ridges to the E, S & W, but with low lying bog to the N & NW.... [SMR file] And that of 1997: The site is located on top of a low rise with excellent views over bogland towards Lough Sheelin to the north-west. Condition: Poor. The site is very difficult to make out. The site is now under pasture. Description: The site consists of the remains of a ring-barrow. It consists of a low circular mound, c. 5m-5.2m in diameter and c. 20cms in height, surrounded by a fosse. The fosse has an overall width of c. 1.8m. Its base is 20cms in depth beneath external ground level. [SMR file] An undated, very abbreviated account which appears not to be based on a site visit describes it simply as a small low circular mound of earth is delimited by a shallow fosse which in turn is surrounded by a low earthen bank [SMR file]. This account, though it mentions an outer bank, should probably be rejected in favour of those descriptions clearly based on a site visit. From these accounts, this tiny earthwork placed atop a large prominent natural ridge with excellent views over bogland towards Lough Sheelin to the north-west, might be interpreted as a ring-barrow with the bank flattened by past cultivation. If there never was a bank, the level interior raised 0.2m above ground level, which can be gathered from the 1981 and 1997 accounts suggests that this monument might be either a type of ring-barrow with no external bank or a ditch-barrow, a type more recently identified by ASI fieldworkers.

For a stretch of 10m at NNW, bank appears to have been mostly removed and the ditch filled in. On NE side, where it appears also to have been damaged, bank bulges outwards and is most massive, possibly incorporating spoil from removal of adjoining stretch of bank at NNW. Although bank and ditch are densely overgrown on W side, visible parts of ditch are fairly uniform in width (2.8m (NE), 2.7m (SE), 2.7m (SW)); the slightly broader range of corresponding measurements for the bank (4.5m (NE), 4.2m (SE), 4.0m (SW)) are attributable to differential erosion of its exterior. Bank rises up to 0.5m above external ground level and up to 1.15m above ditch on E side, and up to 0.2m above central platform on NE side.

At S, bank rises 0.67m over base of ditch and 0.26m over external ground level. Where best preserved at NW, bank is 2.3m in width, and here the ditch is 2.1m in width. On NE half of upper surface of central mound are two large limestone boulders with prominent solution hollows, the larger 1.5m across, the smaller 0.95m across; another two boulders, the larger 1.2m across, the second far smaller, lie at the junction of mound and ditch on E side, and a further example, 1.15m across, lies on crest of outer bank at W; a group of boulders generally of much smaller size, not shown on plan, lie in ditch and on inner slope of bank at NW. At NE side the ditch is not visible, creating a kind of causeway; here the bank is greatly reduced in size, being no higher than line of ditch, and appears to straighten out for c. 8m, giving the monument an approximately D-shape. The straight edge to the barrow here, defined by a low scarp, runs NW-SE and continues as a scarp, broken in places and apparently natural, to SE and, from aerial photographs, apparently, also for some distance to NW, and seems to demarcate the once-marshy ground adjoining the stream, which was formerly flooded, including this monument, within living memory.  Monument lies 102m to SW of a NW-SE flowing stream.

Greatest height of mound over ditch is 0.46m at SSW; where bank is best preserved at NW, it is 2.50m in width and rises 0.15m over ditch and 0.31m over external ground level, but is 0.22m lower than the central mound; width of ditch at NW is 3.30m. A modern field fence runs NE-SW across SE edge of site; this is just within the line of an older field ditch, shown on First Edition OS 6 map (1838), which appears to have removed the outer bank for a stretch of 11m at this point. There appear to be traces of a second, outer ditch, between 5.20 and 5.50m in width, on N side; and possibly a second bank beyond this, but these are both very faint and are not shown on the plan; the ditch is best preserved in an arc running from a stream (see below), which lies 2.50m from inner bank at SW side of site, through N to NE where it reaches the modern field fence; and further possible traces of outer face of ditch and outer bank are visible across field fence to SE. Unless the stream has been redirected at some point, outer bank could never have been complete on SW side. Although land on which it is sited slopes down gradually towards stream to SW, barrow has nonetheless been kept level by making central mound higher and more massive on SW side.

Barrow III is a low circular mound with a slight central depression surrounded by a round-bottomed ditch of varying width with a low broad earthen bank at its outer edge. The mound is 15m in diameter and 1 .20m higher than the bottom of the ditch. The ditch is 7  8 broad, the bank 6m broad and about 20 cm high. The 1973 excavation was limited to a preliminary cutting in the N.E. quadrant. This revealed a portion of a pit under the centre of the mound which rises to a maximum height of 40 cm above the old ground surface. Limited excavation of the upper pit-fill produced many fragments of cremated human bone. The cutting exposed two parallel arcs of irregularly weathered grey-white limestones resting on the old ground surface underneath the mound. The arcs, possibly parts of two concentric rings, are 1 .20m and 3.80m from the centre. The stones which have small spaces between them average 30cm long x 25cm broad x 25cm high. Between the two arcs in a concentration of smaller stones. All save four were resting on the old ground surface. Between these stones and on the ancient soil were many fragments of charcoal. Where excavated the ditch was found to have been c. 2.60m deep originally. Traces of broad cultivation ridges were found crossing the bank. One of these yielded a 19th century clay pipe bowl. A thick layer of ancient soil with a clearly defined limit 3m outside the outer lip of the ditch was found beneath the bank The ancient soil and ditch fill promise to yield considerable ecological data.

N-S) in high relief, its N half and parts of its S perimeter now covered by vegetation. It comprises a roughly circular, flat-topped central mound or platform (Diam. (top) 17.1m N-S; Diam. (base) 19.9m) with sharply defined upper edge and steeply sloping sides, its upper surface sloping down gently to S, which is surrounded by a ditch and a large, flat-topped outer bank. Mound rises 0.74m over ditch on SW side. Ditch is broad, deep and flat-bottomed through U- to V-shaped in section where best preserved, reaching a width of 2.8m at E side where it is not overgrown; in its S side are remains of fallen trees and other vegetation. Where largest on SW side, bank is 2.8m in width and rises 1.28m over base of ditch and 0.65m over nearest part of central platform; although it rises 2.72m over external ground level at this point, its outer face plunges down to the broad side of a large, possibly natural, crescent-shaped hollow (see below) which runs from SW-W, making it difficult to discern where bank ends and natural slope begins; giving a much better sense of actual height of constructed bank, the corresponding measurement just a few metres to E is only 0.74m. Bank is lowest on SE side of monument, where it rises only 0.27m above external ground level.  On E side of monument, running approximately radially across ditch from ENE-WSW is what appears to be a causeway or partially uncut stretch of ditch, 3.10m in width and reaching a height of 0.43m above base of ditch immediately to NW. In its current state this feature is quite irregular in appearance, perhaps due to erosion, and it dips down slightly in the centre so that it is lower than both external bank and central platform; nonetheless it has the rough appearance of a causeway and was tentatively identified as such, along with a corresponding gap in the bank (see below), by the ASI fieldworker who visited the site on 19/5/71 [SMR file].  There appears to be a breach in the outer bank beside the causeway but this is much narrower than the latter and even less regular in appearance, with bank on its N side being much higher and more massive than on S side, where it has been much reduced in height. The bank becomes more massive at the point where the natural ground surface begins to plunge down dramatically as a natural escarpment around NW half of monument, further increasing the apparent height of bank; this appears closely similar to the situation at SW, where bank rises by 0.66m close to the point where its outer face plunges into the crescent-shaped hollow (see above). The bank is much lower and less massive on SE half of monument.  In a postscript, the ASI fieldworker who visited this site on 19/5/71 makes a case for the causeway and corresponding gap being secondary, drawing on observations of certain features which appear now to be concealed by fallen trees and other vegetation on S side of monument: The gap and causeway at the E would appear to be later features. The trench which cuts through the bank and fosse on the S. extends round to E. and has a slight bank along its NW side. The bank is against the inner side of the fosse between S. and E. it crosses the fosse to make causeway-like features [SMR file].  Monument is located on a low rise in undulating pasture, right on the brink of a natural escarpment, and up against what appears to be a second, at least partly natural, crescentshaped hollow, so that the height of its NW edge, where the bank is most massive, is greatly exaggerated by the natural slope. The irregular, stony ground at the base of the crescent-shaped hollow might preserve the foundations of some structure if it does not indicate recent quarrying; the ASI accounts of 19/5/71 and 3/7/78 both identify the hollow as a disused quarry [SMR file].

Monument has been deliberately placed on sloping ground rather than on more even ground, or on a local summit; but its builders have made it more massive on N side than S, in order to ensure that it remained approximately level. Bank is up to 4.10m in width and, rising 0.92m over the ditch, is of a similar height to the central platform, which rises 0.90m over the ditch. Height of bank, taken down to a break in the steep natural slope immediately NE of the barrow, is 0.88m; there is a further drop of 1.22m before the natural ground levels out, so that the monument is most imposing from this side in the same way that the other Porterstown ring-barrow (WM027-036----), placed on the edge of an escarpment but kept approximately level, is most striking when seen from the N where its banks are most massive, and further exaggerated by following the slope of the escarpment.  Although this was not observed on a single, short visit to the site by the survey-team, the ASI account of 17/5/71 notes that On the W a slight earthen bank can be seen, extending approx E, on the central area [SMR file].  Although the monument is currently identified as a ringfort on the NMS website, one of the ASI accounts (17/5/71) is nonetheless headed Ring-Barrow? [SMR file], and this classification seems most fitting: there is no clear evidence for an inner bank and there are three other ring-barrows (WM027-020----; WM027-021----) close by, at least two of them within sight in Riverstown; the well-preserved ring-barrow at Porterstown (WM027-036----), only 600m to S, has a very similar appearance, with flat-topped central platform, deep ditch and large external bank, and it too is kept more or less level despite greatly undulating topography, so that one side appears much higher from the outside, where the natural ground is lower.  Monument lies beside road at edge of a large, recently ploughed field; presumably ploughing and related activities are responsible for removal of bank and ditch. Although the site is now mostly clear of vegetation, with only a few young trees growing on it and stumps of two older felled trees, it was covered by dense growth and fallen trees when visited by ASI fieldworkers on 17/5/71 and 5/6/80 [SMR file]. As such, while upper surface of central mound has the overall appearance of being flat-topped, it is in fact heavily disturbed with bumps and hollows presumably left by uprooted trees and burrowing animals.

There are clear traces of a counterscarp bank just outside ditch at NE and S, and slighter traces of one at NW, which would increase overall dimensions for enclosure. Main enclosure bank rises up to 0.5m above interior at S side, where it rises 1.05m above the ditch and 0.90m above the counterscarp bank.  Overall width of flat-topped inner bank is 3.4m at E side, its upper surface 0.80m across. Width of bank at S side is 1.7m, where width of ditch is 1.5m. Part of outer face of inner enclosing bank has been poached, especially on S side. Long axis of enclosure runs roughly N-S (NNW-SSE), with corners being sharpest at NW and SW, and more rounded at NE and especially SE. Interior of enclosure is raised up to 0.50m above external ground level at NE corner but is higher than ground level on all sides. Slippage from the inner bank and raised interior has occurred in various places, most notably midway along W side, although the ASI account of 13/4/70 suggests that this might be the original entrance [SMR file].  At N side of interior of enclosure are remains of what appears to be a greatly damaged ring-barrow (Diam. 10.5m E-W), comprising a ransacked central mound (Diam. 6.5m E-W) surrounded by a roughly circular ditch and an outer bank which is best preserved at E but almost obliterated on S side. Mound rises 0.23m above ditch on E side, where bank rises 0.19m above ditch. It is possible that this is not a ring-barrow, not least in view of its unusual location within a rectangular enclosure; the ASI account of 26/7/72 queried its identification as a ring-barrow, while that of 13/4/70 had described it as two slight banks forming concentric arcs with the open sides on the S., suggesting that These could represent a two-period house site. The inner structure [i.e. the hollowed mound of the ring-barrow] having been built inside the outer. Given its hilltop location amidst the important Killucan group of barrows, and that some other enclosed ring-barrows are known from Ireland, this writer is much more inclined to opt for identification as a ring-barrow.  Monument is located on prominent hilltop close to mobile phone mast; visibility would be excellent all round but for trees. Barrow forms part of a loosely knit cemetery on and around the elevated ground W of Killucan, including two in Rathwire Upper townland (WM020-124----; WM020-123----) within 1.3km to S, and a tight cluster of four or five others in Rathnarrow townland within 1.2km to S.See attached plan of monument surveyed and drawn by the ASICompiled by: Caimin O'Brien based on details provided by David McGuinness.Date of upload: 10 February 2016",,,,,

From the ASI account of 13/4/73, the bank and ditch appear to have been in far better condition forty years ago: This consists of a wide deep V-shaped circular fosse with a substantial bank of earth outside it. Inside the fosse is a circular almost flat-topped steep mound like feature. The site is so densely overgrown that it is difficult to judge whether or not some of the fosse material was thrown on to it.  At present the almost flat top of the area inside the fosse would suggest that is it in fact a ring-barrow. [SMR file] Elsewhere its overall diameter is given as 22.5m [SMR file]. Although earthen in appearance, probing indicates that the mound contains much stone. Poaching has removed parts of edge of mound at N, W and SW, but a slight depression in its upper surface might indicate ransacking by treasure hunters, if not a collapsed cist. Probable ditch at S side of mound is 1.7m in width; bank beyond this is 1.5m in width and rises 0.26m above the ditch. On historic OS 25 map, ditch is shown as complete, and an external bank is depicted for NW quadrant. There is a sub-rectangular, tongue-like projection at E side of mound, 2.5m in length, 2.3m in width and up to 0.2m in height; there appears to be a corresponding projection at W side, 2.8m in length, 2.7m in width and 0.4m in height.

Opposing entrance gaps occurred at NW (Wth c. 3.65m) and SE (Wth c. 2.4m) and were matched by corresponding, undug, causeways across the fosse. The circular interior (diam. c. 11.6m) was covered by a layer of broken rock (D c. 0.3m) and contained a centrally placed cremation. A second cremation was found in the fosse at N. Finds included eight worked flints, a spindle whorl, two sherds of red 'gritless' pottery, a jet spoon, an iron file and a fragment of fused blue glass. An Iron Age date was suggested for the monument, which was subsequently restored to it's original morphology.  Compiled by: Gearóid Conroy  Date of upload: 10 June 2011",,,,,

Partial excavation by O'Riordáin (1950, 259-269: Site 6) revealed a two-period monument. Phase 1: comprised a low central mound of earth and stone covering the extended inhumation of an adult (head to NW), enclosed by two concentric fosses (c. 6m and c. 8m from the centre) and two smaller fosses close to the central mound - a possible multiple ring-barrow. O'Riordáin suggested that the larger fosses had external banks and that the smaller fosses provided material for the central mound. Phase 2: a cemetery of twelve extended inhumations (head to W), including two children, three adults, two adult females and four adult males was enclosed by the large fosse and bank visible today, and the central mound was also enlarged during this phase. Finds (none directly associated with burials) included six pieces of flint (two worked), one polychrome glass bead (white, yellow and blue), several sherds of medieval pottery and three other sherds with horizontal-line decoration.

A detailed gradiometer survey was conducted by J. M. Leigh Surveys Ltd. under licence No. 18R0026 in the townland of Powerscourt Demesne, which identified a possible triple-ditched barrow (approx. overall diam. 25m).  The site consists of a small circular area (approx. diam. 8m) enclosed by three widely spaced circular ditches.  The outer circular ditch has a diameter of 25m, the middle ditch 16m and the inner ditch 8m (Leigh 2018, 4).  Archaeological test trenching was undertaken by Irish Archaeological Consultancy Ltd. on behalf of Lota View Holdings Limited, under licence No. 18E0045 in order to archaeologically assess the results of the geophysical survey. The test trenching confirmed the presence of a probable barrow (c. 25m diameter), with three enclosing ditches. No evidence of a burial or cremated remains was identified during the test trenching (Lynch and Kavanagh 2018, i).  The south?western part of the barrow appears to have been removed by agricultural ploughing. Two of the three ditches were identified on the north?eastern side of the site, although the outer ditch was sealed by a spread of archaeological material. The inner ditch was found to have a depth of 0.34m, which suggests that the entire monument has been subject to some truncation due to ploughing.  A number of lithics were recovered during testing, including a quartz core, several individual pieces of quartz and a piece of flint debitage. The items were all recovered from the archaeological spread (C7) and the fill of one of the barrow ditches (ibid., 7).  Compiled by: Caimin O'Brien  Date of upload: 14 May 2018",,,,,

It comprises a circular ditch (D 0.6m) with an internal diameter of c. 8.5m which encloses a mound. There were no surviving traces of an external bank. Within the mound was a supine juvenile inhumation in poor condition, and there was no indication of a formal grave-cut. A pit cut into the mound containing five cattle teeth. The central mound was capped with a layer of clay that contained a pit cremation and a number of small spreads of charcoal. There was a small amount of fragmentary burnt human bone in the cremation, suggesting token deposition. Within the ring-ditch the primary fill contained a large number of fragments of burnt bone. The quantity of this material suggests that it may represent pyre debris. Burnt human and animal bone and disarticulated animal bone was distributed irregularly but appeared in various densities throughout the ring-ditch. The faunal remains included cattle teeth and shed antler. Pieces of struck flint were found (mainly at the four cardinal points), including two thumbnail scrapers, which suggest a possible Bronze Age date (0'Neill 2000, 40-42, ).

The southernmost orthostat, smaller of the two (L. 2.15m; W. 1.4m; H. 1.65m), stands upright against middle step of barrow (no lower step being visible at this point), tilting out slightly due to pressure from the barrow on the W and the exposure of its base on the E due to erosion; it appears to be in situ. The northernmost boulder (L. 3.7m; W. 2.25m; H. 1.5m) lies recumbent just N of the edge of the barrow, which appears to have been severely damaged here and around as far as the other boulder, partly due to animals sheltering under a thorn tree growing beside the southern boulder but perhaps in great part due to the northern boulder having collapsed in the pastespecially if it too had originally stood upright against the barrow, revetting its edge. Flattish to slightly domed upper tier of mound is badly eroded on NW and SE sides but appears to have been originally circular (Diam. 2.3m N-S x 2.5m E-W), and rises up to 1.45m above middle step where this step adjoins the southernmost boulder (see below) on E side. The middle step, only evident in an arc running clockwise from N to SW where it appears to drop down to the lower step, rises up to 0.55m above the lower step at SW, although middle step has been disturbed here. The lower step is evident only in an arc running clockwise from S to NW and rises up to 0.42m above ground level on W side. In width the middle step reaches up to 2.1m at E and the lower step reaches up to 2.9m on W side. On SW side, where the middle step is 2m in width, irregular in appearance and apparently disturbed, it and the upper tier appear to have spilled out onto the lower step. Where the mound has been eroded and the sod removed in many places, it is composed of numerous small stones with some soil, such that it could almost be described as a cairn. As it is in a poor condition, being badly damaged or partly removed on N and NE sides, and with spillage from different tiers on all sides, other readings of this monument than the one given here are conceivable.  Monument is very prominently sited on a local eminence, c. 38.5m to SW of large curvilinear mound (within graveyard wall (WM031-079001-) on which site of medieval church (WM031-079----) of Kilcumreragh is located; ground drops sharply 12m to NE of barrow before rising again towards the church.  Little is known about the history of this church. When John ODonovan visited the site in 1837, the locals had entirely forgotten the latter part of the name, referring only to the parish of Kill, and the original dedication to a native, pre-Norman saint had been replaced by one to St. Thomas. But ODonovan knew well his Martyrologies and saints Lives: Groping thus in the dark it is very difficult (for one) to come to any certain conclusion and still I have no hesitation in asserting with every confidence that this is the church of comráire near Uisneach, where in the primitive ages St. Colman was venerated on the 25th of September (Herity 2011, 76).  In support of this, Leo Swan inferred from the quadrantal shape of the graveyard an original monastic enclosure or vallum having formerly surrounded the site, sound indication of an early medieval origin (1988, 17)'.

This feature, which runs for many hundreds of metres to N of site, appears from aerial photograph on ASI website to end about 150m to S of barrow, possibly at a large oval enclosure. It is clear from this aerial photograph that the linear feature swerves slightly to E to avoid the barrow'.    Compiled by: Caimin O'Brien based on details provided by David McGuinness.

It is visible on the OSi series of aerial photographs (2005) and on Bing images (c. 2013), and it was first noticed by Katherine McCormack. This is a circular area (diam. 40m N-S; 37m E-W) defined by a steep scarp (at W: Wth 4.4m; H 1.25m) with a berm (at W: Wth 3m) separating it from a scarp or natural slope (at W: Wth 7.0m; H 1.4m) SW-W-NNW. The perimeter declines to low scarp (Wth 4.0m; H 0.8m) NNW-SE and merges into a natural scarped slope (Wth 17.9m; H 3.4m) SE-SW.  There are ramp entrances at N (Wth 3.2m) and at NNE (Wth 3.5m), which are c. 4m apart, and there are traces of a fosse (Wth of top 5.75m; Wth of base 1.25m; D 0.1m) NW-NE. The interior slopes down slightly to the N and there is an enclosure inside the perimeter at S. This is a penannular area (dims c. 12m E-W; c. 11.5m N-S) defined by a slight scarp ENE-SE (Wth 2.2m; H 0.05m) and SW-WNW (Wth 1.9m; H 0.3m), but the perimeter is incorporated into that of the platform SE-SW and is absent elsewhere.

Platform has a sharply defined edge, possibly due in part to ploughing in its immediate vicinity, and rises up to 1m above ground level on SE side; the mound is up to 1m in height above the platform. There is an unpublished plan and profile of the monument in the SMR file.   Monument is located on a low eminence in undulating, reclaimed pasture and ground drops away to SE more sharply than NW. Monument is marked  Mweeleen Moat on OS  6 map, the first term (maoilín, in the sense of bald or bare) apparently descriptive of the appearance of this prominently sited barrow. According to Kane, monument goes by the name Croc na Maoil, or sometimes Cnoc na Maoilin, and he identified it as one of the three bald hill of Meath, whose tops were cut off by Ferguss sword in the Táin Bó Cúailnge. Shaw dismisses Kanes suggestion, identifying the monument as a sepulchral tumulus (Kane 1916-17, 563, Shaw 1921, 127)'.Monument described in 1977 as a small circular shaped earth and stone mound surrounded by a flat berm like feature. The circular shape of the delimiting berm has been altered by land spill on the N side and defaced and destroyed on the S and W by the line of a post-1700 field fence (now removed). This has produced the rather straight profile on this side. There is a distinct round curve to E and N to the original curve of the berm feature. Probably a small bell barrow.

A medieval roadway annotated as 'Bohereenamarve' runs past the monument 20m to the W,  Templecross church (WM011-051----) and graveyard (WM011-051001-) 600m to NE.  A small circular-shaped mound that appears to have been landscaped in the post-1700 period when a curving terrace leading to the top was built.  The mound is enclosed by a wide berm with traces of a slight bank and narrow deep fosse which seems to have ben re-cut in the post-1700 period possibly when the monument was enclosed by a field boundary.  A  causewayed entrance feature at N appears to be a post-1700 feature.  A spiral step pathway has been cut into the mound from NNE, curving around to the top of the mound. The top of the mound was used as a trigonometrical station by the OS marking the spot height of 277ft.   The landscaping of the monument and the deepening of the fosse may have been related to landscaping carried out by the OS when placing their trig. station on top of the mound.  The stepped-barrow stands in the centre of a large circular enclosure (approx. diam. 33m) which appears to date from the post-1700 period when the monument was enclosed by a circular field boundary.  The larger circular enclosure is clearly visible on aerial photograph taken in 1969 (CUCAP AYR008).  The monument could be interpreted as a prehistoric bell-barrow or stepped-barrow which was either landscaped as an ornamental mound or modified by the Ordnance Survey in the 19th century when a trig station was placed on top of the mound.See attached profile of monument surveyed and drawn by the ASI.

The overall diameter of the monument given above should be taken as an approximation, as its construction from a natural knoll makes it difficult to distinguish between the outer slope of the bank and the natural slope of the knoll. Mound is partly eroded on W side, exposing boulders beneath the sod, some very large. Mound has a markedly flattish upper surface (Diam. 9.3m N-S x 9.5m E-W) which rises up to 2.1m above ditch on W side and slopes down 0.86m from W to E; there is a sharp junction between top and sides of mound. Bank and ditch also slope down from W to E, the bank being much higher on W side than on E. Where highest and most massive at W, bank is 7.5m in width and rises up to 0.63m above the ditch and up to 1.4m above external ground level; at E end of monument, as on N and S sides, bank is barely visible, such that there is more of a step on a level with the base of the ditch, which then falls off to the natural slope of the knoll; this berm-like feature is up to 7m in width. Breaches in the bank, probably due to erosion, are evident on NE and SE sides. On NW side there is a funnel-shaped gap in the bank measuring 6m from inside to outside, widening towards the outside; to S of gap, bank is much thinner than to N. Ditch is up to 3.8m in width, where clearest on W side. Outside bank on E side of monument are two other low mounds apparently forming part of the same glacial feature on which barrow is situated.

As upper mound is not located centrally on lower platform, being located closer to NE than SE side, step varies greatly in width, being 1m at N, 2.4m at S, 3.6m at W and 4.8m at E; the narrow step on N side is not clearly evident as a flat area. Upper mound rises up to 1.9m above step on N  side, and overall height of monument reaches up to  4m  at S. An  additional low  step at base of monument on N side appears to relate to the construction of field fence on this side. Upper mound has large boulders or rock outcrop visible around the edges and on top, apparently representing the natural topography; this, and the fact that there is no ditch visible around this substantial monument, strongly suggests that it, like many other Westmeath barrows, has been shaped from a kame or other pre-existing glacial landform. Thorn trees are growing on and especially around the edge of the monument except for a short arc of perimeter on SE side.

Mound B is 6m from Mound A and Mound C is 11.5 m from Mound B. The mounds have been severely eroded by cattle in recent times, Mound A and especially Mound B having lost large pieces on the perimeter. This is most striking when they are compared with the photograph published by Shaw in 1921 (Pl. 1).Mound A: Tall, steep-sided, roughly conical mound with flat top (Diam. 15.7m N-S x 17m E-W) on ground sloping down to E and SE, so that its height above surrounding ground varies from 2m on SW side to 2.7m on SE side. Flat top of mound measures 4.1m N-S by 4.6m E-W and slopes down gently from S to N, with a drop of 11cm, and from E-W, with a drop of 16cm. Between one-third and half way up the sides of the mound is a thin ledge (0.5m in width where best preserved at NE) running horizontally around its circumference in contrast with the varying ground level, and reaching a height of 1.16m above ground level where most clearly defined at NE. This ledge also marks a break in slope in the mound's profile, the upper part being slightly steeper.

This ditch and bank run roughly E-W from a N-S running hedgerow at W end, curving outwardly to N in a gentle arc around the flattish hilltop, but, 70m to E of the hedgerow, ditch is no longer apparent and bank swerves to NE, or rather appears to join onto a second bank which runs in a NE-SW direction. The NE stretch of this bank is 2.5m in width and 0.5m in height and runs for 6.7m to NE from its point of junction with the E-W running bank and ditch before reaching a gap 23m in width, apparently an entranceway, and then continuing for another 24m downhill to NE where it abruptly ends just 1m before joining at a sharp angle onto a N-S running bank and ditch. The SW stretch of this bank is separated from NE stretch by a gap of 2m. It runs for 23m to SW, with two slight but clear kinks, until it joins onto or runs along N side of Mound C and then continues in SW direction for another 19m, before finally kinking to S and running for another 3.5m.The S side of the hilltop is delimited by a roughly E-W-running ditch with hedgerow on its S side, which swerves S to curve around Mound A at a distance of 2.7m.

Overall diameter of the monument is 40.4m N-S x 40.2m E- W.   It is located at edge of state forestry plantation in grounds of the old Clanhugh Demesne, and there are mature deciduous trees associated with the demesne along its perimeter; in addition, SE half is densely overgrown with brambles and difficult to examine.   The central platform (Diam. 20m N-S  x 21.5m E-W) is slightly dished, especially on NE side, and rises up to 0.70m above inner ditch on NNE side. The  inner ditch, which is raised well above external ground level, is up to 3m in width, flattish to flattened V-shaped in section, and, on NE side, reaches a maximum depth of  0.45m below and perpendicular to a line joining top of bank to upper surface of platform.   On S and W sides, where external ground level is much lower than elsewhere, central platform drops in a broad, shallow sweep down to a surrounding step or ledge.   On SW side, it rises 1.5m above this ledge and 3.2m above outer ditch.   At its broadest, on W side, the ledge is 7m in width and it reaches as high as 1.4m above ground level beyond outer ditch.  The shallow outer ditch, 2.2m in width, is best preserved on S and SW sides, but further traces are visible on E and NW sides.  Bank on NE half of monument varies in width from 3.5 to 6.8m.  Where not obscured by vegetation, its   height above inner ditch varies from 0.10m on N side to 0.43m on NE side.   It rises up to 1.15m above outer ditch on NW side.   Ground around monument slopes down sharply to W, though much less so on other sides.  Monument lies 21m N of NE shore of Lough Owel. Frewin Hill (WM011-133----) is prominent to SW from adjacent lakeshore, and the sites would be mutually visible across the lake but for the trees at Clanhugh Demesne.   There is an enormous, monumental bivallate ringfort (WM011-109----) in the forest c.0.45km to NNE'.

The presence of the circular-shaped mound in the centre of the monument suggests that this monument represent the remains of burial site rather than a ringfort.  The mound in the centre of the site was described in 1976 as an unusual feature the purpose of which was uncertain. The mound could represent the remains of a burial mound enclosed by an internal fosse with berm and external fosse.  The profile of the monument suggests that this site may be the remains of a barrow.

The site was destroyed by housing in 2002.'  Description from The Prehistoric Settlement of the Lee Valley, Tralee, Co. Kerry; A Landscape Perspective by Michael Connolly.

A low circular mound, 4.00m in diameter, now grass covered but apparently composed of stone, is surrounded by a bank curving from west through south to south-east. This bank has an average width of 4.00m and an average external height of 0.35m. From east through north to north-west the limestone outcrop has been cut into to form the remainder of the enclosing element. The top of this cutting is level with the ground surface of the limestone spur. The circular mound is slightly off-centre, being more to the north. This mound is surrounded by a depression from east through south to south-west, which at its deepest is 0.75m below the crest of the mound and a maximum width of 5.00m, but it is not clear if this is, in fact, an internal ditch.

The portion of land on which these sites occur slopes gently westwards. The main features within the complex are earthen enclosures, small mounds, a linear earthwork and a possible barrow with portions of double banks remaining. All of these sites are partially denuded due to reclaimation, this field still being slightly marshy despite efforts to reclaim the land for the purposes of pasture.............to the east of the terminus of the above earthwork [KE038-152----] is a possible, though substantially denuded barrow, which would appear to be surrounded by a second bank from north through east to south to south/south east. The barrow takes the form of a sub-circular bank, averaging 4.50m in width and surviving to a maximum of 0.50m above external ground level at north. This encloses a shallow ditch, 1.50m in width, which was 0.30m below the crest of the bank. This ditch is 0.38m below the level of the circular central platform, which is 6.00m in diameter. Total dimensions of the barrow are 18.0m E-W by 16.0m N-S. Surrounding this at an approximate distance of 10.0m is a second bank.

The top (diam. c. 5-6m) of the mound is intermittently defined by several low, moss-covered stones protruding from the sod. The stones vary in size; two on the N side are large and appear set in the ground, but there are also smaller stones, some of which may be field clearance. A large boulder abuts the base of the mound at S. Engulfed in blackthorn, hawthorn and brambles; difficult to examine.

Ground falls away c. 60m to S into an area of lowlying marshy ground.  This consists of a circular mound (diam. 5m) with gently domed profile, slightly flattened on top (diam. c. 2m), with low, broadly sloping sides (Wth slope c. 1.5-2m; H 0.3m at NW; 0.6m at SE) that grade into the slope of the ridge on which it is located. The mound is grass-covered. The S side has been partly eroded away, revealing the largely stone-free, earthen core of the mound. According local information, this location was traditionally known as Sheeaun.  The ridge, on which the barrow is located, consists of an elongated, grass-covered mound (L c. 70m; Wth c. 15m; H c. 2m) orientated NWSE axis. It has a narrow, flattened top (Wth 3-4m NESW) and steep, broadly sloping sides. At both the NW and SE ends, the mound tapers off in a long, gentle slope that grades into the surrounding field surface at SE, and at NW terminates at, or is slightly truncated by, a N-S field fence. The SW side of the ridge appears to have been partly dug away or scarped back in the past. Close to the SE end, there is a shallow, square or rectangular depression (3m NWSE; c. 3-5m NW-SE) which also appears to be the result of past disturbance. The nature of the ridge as a whole is uncertain. It may be a glacial deposit but, in this locality, its size and form are unusual. The possibility that it was artificially created cannot be ruled out entirely but, on the present evidence, it is taken to be a natural feature.

The monument has been impacted on by the construction of the N20. Indicated with hachures on the 1924 OS 6-inch map, as an oval platform or mound (diam. c. 40m NW-SE; 20m N-S). Test excavations were carried out in 1997 by Audrey Gahan for ADS (97E0287), in advance of road construction for the N20/N21. The site 'appeared on inspection as a sub circular mound. Slight depressions in the surrounding area suggested the possibility of a ditch. The mound, which was approximately 15m in diameter, was constructed by layers of redeposited subsoil. A row of large stones was uncovered which may represent kerbing. That the mound had been heavily truncated became immediately apparentUnder the redeposited material the remains of a ditch, encircling the mound, were uncovered. This was roughly v-shaped and was also largely filled with redeposited subsoil. The possible remains of a second ditch were found, between 1m and 2m beyond the first ditch. This was ill-defined and was filled by redeposited boulder clay. No artefacts were recovered which could suggest a date for the site.  Excavations by Frank Coyne of Aegis under licence No. 99E0630 were summarised as following; 'This site was first noted during fieldwork for an archaeological impact assessment for the Limerick Southern Ring Road and identified as a possible barrow. It was subsequently test-trenched and found to be of archaeological merit and was then excavated from December 1999 to February 2000.  This site was almost perfectly circular, measuring 14.5m north-south by 14m, and survived to a maximum height of 0.75m. It was already known from local information that this mound was substantially denuded in recent years in an attempt to level the land. However, a sufficient amount of the site survived to indicate two distinct phases of activity. It appears that this site originally took the form of a low mound, created from a layer of stone cobbles and capped with a layer of redeposited clay. This clay was removed in recent years in the course of land improvements, but the cobbled layer survived. A small quantity of cremated bone and a quantity of charcoal were recovered from this surface. Removal of this layer of cobbles exposed a substantial amount of pre-mound activity in the form of several irregular cut features in the naturally occurring boulder clay. The largest of these measured 3.18m north-south by 4.54m, having a depth of almost 2m. A substantial amount of charcoal was recovered from this cut, as was a quantity of animal bone, a piece of flint and portion of a human femur.   A nearby pond, which curved around the site from west to north, measuring 25m in length, may have been the source for the original clay capping of the site. Several post-holes were excavated around the perimeter of the site but did not form any discernible pattern.  A 50m area was stripped of topsoil on either side of this site, but no additional features were uncovered. No enclosing element was uncovered. The available evidence seems to point to this site being the remains of a funerary monument in the barrow tradition.",,,,,

A tumble of loose stones was noted on the external slope of the bank. The base of the platform is enclosed all round by a fosse (Wth 3m) with an external bank (Wth 5m; int. H 1.5m; ext. H c. 3.6m). A tumble of loose stones is evident on the internal and external slopes of this bank, most noticeably at NW. The interior is mostly level with a slight slope down to SE.

Earthwork (LI040-097----) lies 25m to SE.  Impressive trivallate earthwork (overall diam. c. 105m) depicted on 1897 ed.

It has a low mote in the centre, girt by a ring of level field, fenced by a ring mound and two fosses and mounds, fairly concentric, and measuring 280 feet (85m) overall.  There seems to be traces of a causeway through the marsh to the east, but there are no entrance gaps on that side.  The fosses are as wide as the rings and are literally filled up with lush marsh vegetation, rushes, peppermint and such water-loving plants.  The interspace round the mound is from 42 feet (12.8m) to 45 feet (13.7m) wide.  The mote is from 6 feet to 7 feet (1.8m-2.1m) high, 60 feet to 62 feet (18.2m- 18.9m) across the summit, 87 feet (26.5m) to 90 feet (27.4m) in diameter at the base; it has no apparent house sites.

Visible on Google Earth orthoimage dated 14/09/2019 as a trivallate earthwork intersected at N by field bank running E-W with an agricultural yard immediately to N.   Classification of this impressive monument is uncertain, Westropp suggested that this earthwork was the remains of a trivallate ringfort, however the small central platform enclosed by a wide wet fosse is more akin to a burial site in the barrow tradition rather than a trivallate ringfort.

H 1.05m) which is best preserved in the N-NE and almost reduced to scarp elsewhere. There is a slight, roughly circular raised area in the interior (dims. 5.8m N-S; 5.4m E-W; H 0.05m) which is off-centre towards the northern edge of the monument. A deep wide field ditch, running E-W, truncates the monument in the S quadrant. The E quadrant is similarly truncated by a field bank and ditch running N-S. A field ditch runs N-S along the external base of the bank in the W quadrant. In the N quadrant there is a wide, flat-bottomed depression (Wth 4.6m; D 0.3m) at the external base of the bank which may be an external fosse though the ground appears to be rising naturally northward, perhaps creating the appearance of a fosse.

This greatly damaged monument is preserved only on N side of E-W running field fence, S side of monument apparently having been removed. Although remaining part of monument is by no means regular in appearance or easily classifiable, it appears to comprise an irregular-shaped mound incorporating blocks of limestone and rising to its highest point on E side. This mound appears to be delimited on E and W halves by a bank, but bank on the W side is on markedly higher ground than that on E, being not much lower than the mound itself. It is not certain that the western stretch of bank is indeed a bank and it does not obviously join up with the much better defined eastern stretch; if it is accepted that the two banks join up to form one half of the perimeter of the monument, its maximum visible diameter from E to W is 46.5m. There appears to be a slight inner ditch associated with both E and W stretches of bank. On E side, where bank is much more low-lying than on W side, the central mound rises 1.95m above the ditch on inside of bank. On E side, bank is 4m in width; on W side it is 2.6m in width. Although this is unclear, eastern stretch of bank appears to veer off to N, running towards the rushy, reedy area close by; if this is so, it would clearly not join up with the western stretch. The aerial photograph  of  the  genuine  barrow in Moyvoughly  on  the  ASI  website,  which  takes  in  the  present monument,  suggests  that  the  impression  of  an  outer  bank  of  unusual  form,  and  by  implication  the monument as a whole, may be the accidental result of the intersection of snaking natural escarpments and man-made banks. Though possibly a barrow, this monument must be treated with serious doubt.   Monument is located in undulating, partly drained pastureland. Immediately to N of monument is a narrow band of low-lying grassland adjoining a rushy area 23m to N of barrow that may formerly have been a lake; part of the lakeshore appears to be delimited by a bank of uncertain origin. In this area of grassland just NW of barrow and between it and the lake is a small oval or subrectangular earthwork possibly representing a hutsite'.

Traces of a shallow ditch are visible immediately beyond the step, running clockwise from S to N or NE; where clearest at NW, this is up to 1.5m in width, which would give an overall diameter for of 38m N-S. In SE quadrant, domed summit slopes down fairly uniformly to edge of mound, but elsewhere, the slope lessens from highest part towards edge of mound, giving the impression of a kind of berm. Numerous limestone boulders and outcrops of rock are visible over surface of mound, especially in NE quadrant and along part of perimeter. Old deciduous trees, located just inside the perimeter of the mound, were clearly planted, probably as shelter for cattle; a few others farther in towards the centre appear younger in date and presumably result from natural seed-dispersal. Clear  traces of a dry-walled revetment to the stepped edge of the mound on SW, S and E sides may relate to the same episode of landscaping that involved the planting of trees; the step is best preserved where the walling has survived, reaching up to 0.84m in height.   Macalister and Praeger examined the mound with no satisfactory results. They had taken it for a mound of stones, possibly a large artificial carn, but it proved to be a mere outcrop of much decomposed rock. Their examination presumably involved some kind of excavation but no record of this has been left.  Their dismissal of the site as a mere outcrop is completely inconsistent with its current appearance, that of an artificially shaped mound, although substantial areas of outcrop were clearly incorporated into it by its builders; its location in immediate proximity to a large ringfort-like structure (WM024-027----) is also consistent with an artificial origin.  Presumably with similar reservations about Macalister and Praegers conclusions, Schot (2006) marks it as a Barrow/mound on her map of the Uisneach complex.  Monument lies on a low eminence just 8m to NNW of the large and complex bivallate ringfort excavated by Macalister and Praeger (1929-31); prehistoric rock art reused in this fort (OReilly 2010) was conceivably taken from the barrow.

Tommy Cassidy of Slane More). Monument is raised above surrounding ground, though its centre is irregularly hollowed out to varying depths (due in part to cattle), and is surrounded by a bank in varying states of preservation. At E side, the clearly defined bank is 5.2m in width; at N side it is 7.3m in width and more massive. At N side bank is raised 1m above external ground level and 1.3m above deepest part of hollowed. area inside. N and E stretches of bank end with a sheer cut just inside modern field boundary, clearly showing where the monument was damaged by road-widening. The bank is very stony, most clearly visible on N side where cattle have worn away the sod; there are many stones in the hollowed interior, especially at the cattle-worn N side, although some of these may have slipped from the bank. It is also to be wondered whether the varying levels of interior of monument might relate to disturbances from time of road-widening project.  In its current state, monument is difficult to classify, although given its appearancea raised area apparently surrounded by a stony bankit is difficult to accept its classification as a barrow in the RMP.  If a burial mound at all, it might be a hollowed out cairn or mound-barrow. In support of its interpretation as a burial monument, there are two barrows c. 50m (WM018-080----) and c. 100m (WM018-079----) uphill in field across road to NE, and on hilltop c. 150m to NE are three further barrows (WM018-078----).

Westmeath but re-classified by McGuinness following field survey of barrows in Co. Westmeath.  Surveyed in 2012 and described by McGuinness (2012, 37-8) as following: Large sub-circular earthwork, comprising a slightly dished platform (Diam. 39.5m NNE-SSW x 43m ESE-WNW) surrounded by a ditch (Diam. 49m NNE-SSW x 50m ESE-WNW), with traces of an external bank. Despite dished appearance of platform, there is no clear trace of a bank around its edge that might justify its classification as a ringfort in the RMP. A field fence marked by mature deciduous trees crosses ESE end of site from NE to SW, so that the monument extends over two fields, with only the smaller segment on ESE side showing traces of a low, external bank, 4m in width, below level of central platform. If bank originally extended into adjacent field, around the entire monumentand there is no reason to doubt that this was the caseoverall diameter would be c. 58m. Where best preserved on SW side, ditch is approximately flat-based, 2-2.5m in width at base, and up to 0.44m in maximum depth below and perpendicular to a line joining upper edge of platform to external ground level, although this measurement must be regarded as minimal given that outer bank is no longer visible in this area. Central mound rises up to 0.64m above base of ditch and appears to be raised above surrounding ground. Monument lies in broadly SW-sloping pastureland, 8m to NE of a bowl-barrow (WM018-080----) and c. 100m to NE of another, possible prehistoric burial mound (WM018-081----).

Monument described as a small oval-shaped area (dims. 60m N-S; 57m E-W) enclosed by a bank (ext. H 1.2m) and external fosse visible from S-SW-W and at NE. No clear entrance feature visible.  The bank has almost been reduced to a scarp, primarily due to ploughing.  The ground across the bank, fosse and interior has traces of cultivation ridges running NNW-SSE which appear to have denuded the enclosing elements and interior to their present low profile state. The ground within the interior rises towards the centre where there is a wide, flat platform which is defined by a low bank which is best preserved at N, NE, SW and W. A tree-lined field boundary surrounds the base of the hillock and is not concentric with the bank or fosse. It is flanked on the exterior by a modern drain from S-W. There is a modern quarry hole at the base of the enclosing field boundary at E. Later field banks intersect the enclosing boundary at N and SW.  A Preservation Order was placed on this monument on 17/08/1990 (SMR file).  The classification of this monument is uncertain with the possibility that the low mound or platform in the centre is the remains of a burial mound rather than a house platform.  The profile of the monument and the possibility of the presence of a ditch around the central mound may suggest that this is the remains of a barrow rather than a ringfort with central house platform.

In 1976 a cist burial (WM025-076002-) was exposed when backfilling a small disused gravel pit at the base of a glacial hillock.  The cist was situated just below the break of the hillock on SE facing slope.  Eamonn Kelly of the National Museum of Ireland carried out an investigation of the site and recorded the following details; 'The capstone (dims. 0.91m x 0.76m x 0.08m) was fully removed and the cist was seen to contain a small pottery vessel and a pile of cremated bones.  Excavation relocated the grave (max. L 0.47m x Max. L 0.41m x D 0.5m) which had not been further damaged in the back-filling operation.  It was trapezoidal in shape and was made up of 4 slabs set into a sub-rectangular pit (dims. 0.95m x 0.8m x D 0.5m).  Mr Maguire informed me that a ring-work consisting of an earthen bank approximately 50cm high and 8m in diameter once crowned the knoll.

The circles indicated diameters of c. 12m, 25m, 40m and the arc of the outer circles, if complete, would give diameters of c. 50m, 70m and 90m.

On satellite imagery it is evident that the monument has been levelled, with only the SW edge being retained as part of a field boundary. Given its association with water and its suggested morphology on the 1st ed. map, this may be some form of barrow, which was partially enclosed within the lozenge-shaped area at a later stage.

A possible barrow associated with burials (KK013-099----).

The ridge was quarried and, a great part of the rath has been removedThe excavation thus formed presents a section of the rath, and proves it to be, not a remain of military or defensive class, but a thickly peopled cemetery (ibid.). He describes how, about eighteen inches or two feet under the surface may be seen, protruding from the sides of the sand-pit, human bones, which are found not confusedly buried, but belonging to perfect skeletons which had been interred without any coffin or cist of stones or flags. They lie for the most part with the head to the east, and feet to the west, and show no signs of cremation. I have been assured by the neighbouring peasantry that no arms or ornaments of any kind have ever been turned up; while the human remains are so abundant, that I was informed by one man that he had often carried away as many as two or three skulls in one horse load of gravel (ibid.). He also noted that, the north face of the excavation exhibits a perfect section of a pit sunk into the gravel about five feet deep, and ten or twelve in diameter. This pit may be traced by a well marked line of charcoal, calcined bones, and clinkers or slag (ibid.). Graves presented some of the bones from examination by a Dr. Crane who stated that, the greater portion of them belonged to human beings who appeared, from the teeth, to have been aged about fifty. A few of the bones seemed to have belonged to the skeleton of a sheep (ibid.). The description of the earthwork as a rath, suggests that the monument had an enclosing bank, it was probably a barrow.

The site consists of a circular stone bank enclosing a flat interior. There is no evidence for an entrance feature, internal ditch or funerary deposit; however, it has been substantially disturbed by milling activity. The least disturbed sections, at the field center to the E and W, were cleared of loose peat revealing a bank (Wth 1.37-1.64m). The stones (av. L 0.22m; av. diam. 0.14m) are packed in a haphazard, irregular manner with various stone types and sizes in use. The majority of the stones can be described as cobbles, while a very small number of flags are present. There is a lot of natural wood in close proximity. An ex situ flint flake, a possible hone stone and a possible quartzite hammer stone (01E0663:14; 01E0663:15 and 01E0663:17) were recovered from the stone bank and a possible quartz hammer stone (01E0663:16) was recovered 24.8m to the W. (01E0663:4), a possible arrowhead, may also derive from this site. The site is in a soil-like peat with traces of minerals (e.g. sand) and a thin lens of charcoal immediately below this. SMR OF011-059---- is approximately 15m to the NW and may be associated.  In 2008 archaeological testing was carried out by Jane Whitaker of ADS Ltd. in Toberdaly and Clonin townlands in Ballybeg Bog, Co. Offaly, on 2226 September 2008. A stone enclosure (OF011060---) and stone-lined hearths (OF011059----) were initially identified during a survey by the Irish Archaeological Wetland Unit in 2001, when they were recorded as a barrow and prehistoric habitation site. The sites, which are located 15m apart, were partially excavated by Ellen OCarroll (formerly of ADS Ltd) at the site, in 2002. The area (NGR 251372 / 233357) subject to testing, in 2008, was located on a Bord na Móna production field between the two sites. This central production field was not investigated at the time of excavation but the northern drain face was cleaned and charcoal and stones were recorded within the section. The site has been set aside from production since 2002; however, Bord na Móna wished to establish the full extent of the site in order to put an appropriate programme of works in place. The purpose of the testing was to determine the full extent of the archaeological features/activity at the site. The licence was re-activated and transferred in September 2008. A total of five trenches were excavated by hand to archaeological levels.  Archaeological features were recorded in three of the five trenches and were composed of charcoal spreads and charcoal and stone features. The archaeological activity was orientated north-west/south-east over three production fields and measured 45m in length and a minimum of 35m in width. A total of seventeen flint lithics were recorded and recovered from three of the trenches. The radiocarbon dates obtained after the survey and the excavation indicate that the site, as a whole, dates to between 4220 and 2300 bc (Bennett 2011, 302).

Possible ringfort (WM034-005----) 350m to SE.  A small roughly circular flat-topped, mound (diam. 5.2m N-S; 6.3m E-W; H c. 1.3m) defined by a scarp with slight narrow fosse (Wth 1.6m; D 0.2m) around the base of the mound best preserved from W-N-E, not visible at S.  Traces of a very slight depression visible on the centre of the mound.  Monument surveyed in 2015 and described by McGuinness (2015, 60-3) as following: Monument comprises a roughly square-shaped mound with rounded corners (8.5m NNW-SSE x 9.2m WSW-ENE), flat top (5m N-S x 5.2m E-W) and steeply sloping sides, delimited by a shallow ditch formed of four straight lines (Overall dims. 11.5m NNW-SSE x 13m ENE-WSW), the corners sunken deeper than the channels connecting them as if the ends overlapped; possibly these represent pits or hollows left by decayed timber posts. Mound is oriented ENE-WSW (NE-SW), being higher and more massive at SW end; ditch is slightly trapezoidal in shape, the SW end measuring 11.9m in length while the NE end measures only 10.4m. Where highest at SW, mound rises 1.26m above ditch. Ditch appears to be best preserved on W side, where a thorn tree growing from side of mound arches over it; here it is up to 0.16m below external ground level.  Ditch at E side appears at least as deep but is densely overgrown and inaccessible; ditch is very poorly preserved on S side. Ditch ranges in width from 1.6m at well-preserved W side up to 1.8m at N side. Immediately Beyond ditch on W side is what appears to be a low external bankas this is by no means certain, maximum dimensions for the monument given above are derived from the ditch This barrow, marked Moateen on OS 6 map, is strikingly positioned on flat summit of S end of low but very prominent glacial hillock with long axis running N-S, just N of the N6; and, but for vegetation, there would be good views in all directions. A raised bog visible only a short distance to N has been harvested for peat on an industrial scale, as have other raised bogs to S.  This hillock is at N edge of the pass or strip of dry land that gives the townland its nameless than 1km across at this pointwhich runs E-W between areas of bog that have been an impediment to movement since prehistoric times: a remarkable cluster of ancient trackways has been discovered in the bogs to the S, the nearest cluster being c. 1km to SSE (WM034-009----/010---/01-2----/014----/015----), including one (WM034-014----) that has been radiocarbondated to 1390-1046 cal. BC, placing it around the junction of Middle and Late Bronze Age. The ASI document a possible ringfort (WM034-005----) about 350m to SE. Although not yet examined by the survey-team, a motte (WM034-003----) lying immediately S of the N6 c. 700m to WSW of the present site could, from the ASI account given on the NMS website, be interpreted as a bowl-barrow, perhaps with stepped or otherwise shaped summit like those at Slane More and elsewhere in Ireland (McGuinness 2012, 12-13):  Steep-sided mound (H 2m), there is a low rise on the centre of the summit, the significance of which is unclear. At the base of the motte from NE-E-S-W to WNW there is a wide shallow fosse. No visible trace of a bailey. Traces of linear earthworks in field to the SW are visible on Bing Maps. [and] could be the remains of a medieval road associated with the motte. [NMS website].  Monument lies between two ruined medieval parish churches on sites which Leo Swan (1988, 13, 21) attributed to the early medieval period: Pass of Kilbride, with St Bridgets Well (WM034-001----/002----), only c. 700m to W but not certainly of early medieval date; and Clonfad, 2.5km to ENE, with a ruined medieval church, standing stone, early medieval high cross (Crawford 1927, 1-2) and a burial ground, including the bishops grave, surrounded by sub-circular earthworks representing the enclosing monastic vallum (WM027-066----/067----).

(overall) 14.4m N-S). Mound is mostly well preserved, although part of it appears to have been removed at Sapparently the same feature described in the ASI account as a depression in the top of the mound which continues down the side on the SE, due to disturbance [SMR file]; possibly the site has been ransacked by treasure hunters. Where its edge is damaged on E side and the sod removed, mound can be seen to be composed of earth with some stone. Height of mound above well-preserved ditch on S side is 1.5m, but reaches 1.75m over line of filled-in ditch on E side.  Where best preserved at NW and S, width of ditch is 1.8m and 3.2m respectively; the corresponding depths below ground level at these points are 0.14m and 0.60m. Although shallow and narrow on N and W sides, and not visible at all on E where it was presumably filled in when adjacent NNW-SSE-running field fence was constructed, ditch is both broad and deep on S side, at least in part due to the barrows location on land falling appreciably from S to N. There is no clear evidence of a bank having enclosed the ditch; possible traces of one at S are likely attributable to the natural ground rising in this direction, although the ASI account does refer to a faint bank outside the fosse [which] seems to have been redug in the past [SMR file].  Barrow is situated in pastureland close to road.

Although neither ASI fieldworker who saw the site in the 1970s refer to a bankthe 17/5/71 account, headed Platform barrow?, describes the site as A small circular or sub-circular low, smooth sided platform surrounded by a wide shallow fosse [SMR file]an outer bank is nonetheless clearly depicted on the 1838 OS 6 map. Where ditch is deepest and best preserved at SE, it is sunk 0.74m below mound and 0.11m below bank.  When the site was visited by the ASI on 17/5/71, it had been ploughed recently and it supports corn now [SMR file], indicating that the monument was more pronounced until quite recently.  Barrow is situated in undulating pasture that has been under the plough in the recent past, and which slopes down very gently, but noticeably, from WNW-ESE; it lies a short distance N of the Royal Canal, just S of which again passes the main railway from Dublin to Sligo. Immediately to W is a crescent-shaped hollow with high back wall to N and low bank forming mouth on lower S side, which is marked on 1838 OS 6 map; this type of feature, taken to be artificialin one case a quarryby ASI fieldworkers on 17/5/71 and 22/7/76 [SMR file], is common in the Westmeath landscape and found near other barrows (WM013-016----; WM020-015----), and appears to be a dead-ice hollow where a fragment of ice left by a retreating glacier was embedded in the gravel and silt at the front of glacier, and then melted away (pers. comm.

Monument forms part of a loose grouping of four ring-barrows, lying c. 200m to NW of a second similar, but slightly smaller, one in this townland (WM027-021----), and c. 280m to E of a third in Porterstown (WM027-019----); the fourth ring-barrow, also in Porterstown (WM027-036----) lies across the canal c. 600m to SW. On a gently rounded glacial hillock in Riverstown, on slightly more elevated ground (OD 90-100m) c. 950m to N, ploughing in 1969 uncovered a short rectangular cist containing a crouched skeleton with Early Bronze Age Bowl Food Vessel; radiocarbon assay of the bones yielded a date of 3645±30 BP, falling well within the date range of c. 2200-c. 1800 BC for these vessels (Ó Ríordáin 1972, 234-5; Waddell 1990, 154; Brindley 2007, 67, 74, Table 6).

(overall) 24.6m N-S x 31.7m E-W), broader at W end than E, comprising a large basal mound with gently domed upper surface (Diam. 18.4m N-S x 26m E-W) and delimited by a steep scarp on all sides; on top of this is a low mound, eccentrically positioned 15.2m from broad W end of basal mound but only 6.5m from narrow E end. This upper mound is irregular shaped but roughly circular (Diam. 3.9m N-S x 3.8m E-W), and rises only 0.5m above basal mound where highest on S side. Height of scarp defining basal mound is up to 1.2m on N and S sides; and absolute height of monument, from upper surface of upper mound to ground level, is 2m at SE. Various kerb-like boulders protrude from edges of scarp, with several visible on N and S sides; but these are found at differing heights, and, as one ASI fieldworker observed on 27/7/72, there is no clearly visible indications that they are formally set [SMR file]. Chunks have been removed from edge of mound in various places, especially at NNE but also at SE, the result of cattle erosion or small-scale quarrying; but overall the monument is well preserved. Faint traces of a bank observed by an ASI fieldworker on 10/4/70 were in the disturbed NNE area and, as such, were probably not original [SMR file].  Barrow is sited on a local eminence from which it has at least in part been shaped, given that there is no ditch to account for the massive basal mound. The complex, prominently positioned barrow at Rathwire Upper (WM020-123----) is visible uphill to N, on S slope of hill that is capped by a ring-barrow in an unusual rectilinear enclosure (WM020-087----). Lower down again, a couple of hundred metres to S of present barrow, are two branches of the E-W flowing Riverstown River, a tributary of the Deel.

RATHWIRE UPPER,WESTMEATH,WM020-123----,WM01628,131566,BARO,unclassified,53.514382,-7.157107,"Monument surveyed in 2015 and described by McGuinness (2015, 67-9) as following: Complex, challenging and greatly damaged earthwork, currently comprising an elongated, roughly heel-shaped and steep-sided basal mound or platform (20.1m N-S x 16.4m E-W), with curve of heel to S, on which end is a roughly circular, steep-sided mound with overall EW diameter of 7.6m and flat top (Diam. 3.8m N-S x 4.2m E-W). Basal platform rises up to 1.05m above ground level on E side and 1.1m at W. Its N end is defined by a straight line running at an oblique angle to its long axis; although this has the appearance of having been done by modern farm machinery, and we know that the site has been extensively damaged in recent decades (see below), it nonetheless seems to be depicted on 1838 OS 6 map where it runs at right angles to long axis of monument here shown with its long axis running NNW-SSE. On the surface, this appears to be the result of confusion on the part of the surveyors: the WSW-ENE orientation of the straight line is accurate, but the surveyors have projected the rest of the heel symmetrically at right angles to this line. Earlier accounts provide a significant challenge to this interpretation, however, which will be considered below. Near centre of flat side of heel as it currently presents is an indent 1m in width and c. 2m in depth, sloping up from current edge of mound to top of platform, with the appearance of a ramped entranceway. Close to N end of platform, just S of this indent, is a low, E-W running elongated mound or ridge of earthmuch overgrown when visited by the survey-team on a single occasionwhich effectively blocks direct access from ramp to mound. On its N side, upper mound on S side of platform rises 1m above basal platform which extends 7.8m to N of it; its height is similar above the narrow ledges forming adjacent E and W sides of platform; on S side the slope of side of mound continues that of basal platform, giving a total height of 2.3m at this end of monument.  This site has been severely damaged, leaving it with the appearance of a miniature motte and bailey. For a start, the historic OS 25 map shows a segment of bank composed of three straight lines surrounding SW quadrant of basal platform, c. 10m out from it, which has been removed by ploughing but still shows up in aerial photographs. When the same ASI fieldworker visited the site in both 1970 and 1977, the bank was still visible with a ditch between it and the platform, and more intriguingly, a greater extent of N end of platform survived. The more complete account of 29/4/77 is given here: The site consists of two conjoined artificial earthen mounds enclosed from NW-W-S-SE by an earthen stone bank which is best preserved on the SWW. The bank is absent on the E, NE and N  may have been ploughed out  there are traces of old cultivation ridges between the bank and the mounds in the W sector. Between the bank and mounds there is a wide flat shallow fosse and the area enclosed is roughly set circular or square in plan. Three are no indications of a fosse outside the bank. The bank has been dug into on the SW and here too there are two boulders on the crest. The mounds have a fairly circular shape, the S mound somewhat steeper than the N. There is some recent defacement on the SW slope of the S mound and the N mound has an older depression on top. The junction is regular and show incurving. The bank has sharp corners and a sharp profile. It may be that the two conjoined barrows are the original site with a later stone earthen (field) bank placed on the W-S. There is also a short projecting bank at the SW corner extending down the natural slope. [SMR file] The account of 10/4/70 gives additional information on the mounds and dimensions for the bank: The two conjoined mounds are unusual. They may be barrows or they may be formed from the material of the demolished part of the bank. They are conjoined in the N-S line. The S. one is flat-topped and o",,,,,

Where thickest on W side, it rises 0.76m above ground level; it is most massive here, arguably so that upper surface of mound would appear approximately level despite ground surface sloping down to W. Mound is well preserved except for NE corner, where there has been extensive damage and some small boulders exposed. Flat upper surface of mound slopes down gently from W to E; a slight depression at centre could indicate either ransacking or a collapsed chamber, but more likely it relates to an episode from recent decades, as an ASI fieldworker was informed by the landowner on 18/5/71 that a few years ago one of his farm labourers dug into the mound and found a lot of bones. Although minuscule, this flat-topped mound is most prominently positioned on the flat summit of a striking, steep-sided glacial hillock with stepped base on its W side, the highest of several in the area; visibility is excellent in all directions. A gigantic erratic stands isolated in a field c. 250m to ENE; a large gravel quarry is visible a few fields to S.  This unusual rectilinear mound is not obviously a barrow: As one ASI fieldworker described it on 18/5/71: Barrow? A small, low, sub-circular, steep flat-topped mound of stony earth. It looks as if it is a very modern platform. Its significance is unknown. [SMR file].  The account of 10/6/80, while acknowledging its angular shape, is also sceptical: A small, low, sub-rectilinear, flat-topped mound of earth & stones. There is no visible sign of a fosse. The sides of the mound are relatively steep on the N, S & W, but on the E the mound is somewhat defaced & it slopes gradually there. The N, S & W sides are almost straight & it looks as if the mound has been scarped at some time in the relatively recent past. [SMR file] Nonetheless, this monument in which bones have been found is very strikingly located on a glacial hillock with excellent visibility, a type of location common for barrows in this and other counties; and the recognition of what appears to be a second, prominently sited rectilinear barrow at Pass of Kilbride (WM034-004----), only c. 8km to SW, seems to suggest that it is indeed a barrow, albeit of a hitherto unknown type in Ireland.

During the removal of the sod and topsoil a baulk or section was developed across the centre of the site, thin section clearly showed that at some point in time the surface expression of the earthworks associated with this barrow had been subject to disturbance and that only a small section of bank remained in the form of an earthen bank approximately 0.30m in height, located to the west of the barrow. The barrow itself takes the form of an oval shaped earth-cut ditch measuring on average between 1.00m and 0.90m wide and approximately 0.40m in depth with a diameter of 4.20m E  W and 3.10m N  S. The ditch was continuous with no breaks or openings. The ditch contained three fills or deposits a loose, light brown deposit with the general appearance of topsoil overlaying a lower charcoal-rich deposit (c4), overlaying a light grey silt. During the excavation of the ditch no traces of cremated bone were identified, however the general appearance of (c4) suggested that this deposit was formed by the placing of burnt material within the ditch on a number of occasions and not one single event. In total two fragments of flint blades were retrieved from (c4) and four pieces of flint debitage. During the excavation and assessment of the site no other archaeological features and deposits were recorded.
