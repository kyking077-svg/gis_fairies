Tops,Donegal,DG01721,STCI,Stone circle,54.850398,-7.604751,"This monument, on a hilltop with an extensive outlook in all directions, is known as Beltany Stone Circle. It lies 3.2km NNW of the cemetery of megalithic tombs centred on Kilmonaster Middle townland. It consists of a disturbed artificial platform now c. 0.5m high, perhaps the base of a cairn, bounded by a circle of large stones. The circle is c. 45m in diameter. At present 64 stones stand in the circle, and there may originally have been up to 80. Some large stones are exposed in the disturbed interior. It has been suggested that there may have been a megalithic chamber within the circle (O.D. 1939), perhaps a passage tomb (Ó Nualláin 1995, 15). The earliest accounts of the site seem to be those in the unpublished documentation of the Ordnance Survey dating to the years shortly before the mid-19th century. It is clear that the monument was considerably disturbed at this stage. According to the OS Memoir (1836), there had been a cairn or 'vast heap of stones' within the circle, but it had been removed to form fences in the vicinity. Thomas Fagan (1845-8), who saw the monument in 1846, observed that both the interior and the enclosing circle of stones were much disfigured. He was informed that 'the interior was raised with earth and stones covering and encircling sepulchral graves' and that decayed bones were unearthed here. Excavation would be required to determine whether the enclosed platform is the base of a cairn and whether there was any form of megalithic chamber here.OS Mem oirs, Raphoe parish (1836), 1, 27; Fagan 1845-8, book 10, 28; H.

The above description was published in the 'Survey of the Megalithic Tombs of Ireland. Volume VI, County Donegal.' Compiled by: Eamon Cody (Dublin: Stationery Office, 2002).  The Beltany Stone Circle (National Monument Number No. 463), consists of a disturbed artificial platform c. 0.5m high defined by a circle of large stones of which sixty-four remain but which originally may have numbered about eighty (Boyle-Somerville 1922-3, 212). The stones are of varying sizes and one of them on the NE is covered on the internal side with cupmarks (there is possibly one cupmark on the external side also). The interior of the site was considerably interfered with in the 1930's (Davies 1939b, 293). Great numbers of loose stones are now lying up against the perimeter megaliths and dotted about the surface of the interior. Several stones protrude from the surface of the interior and in the SW sector there is a standing stone 1m high, almost an equilateral triangle in plan, each side .6m. Partially exposed in the ground to the W of the standing stone is the top of a long stone, possibly that referred to by Davies as suggesting a megalithic chamber. To the SE of the circle is an out-lying standing stone (DG070-026002-) 2m high. Boyle-Somerville suggested that this outlier as well as other features of the adjacent horizon were employed by the circle builders to determine astronomical alignments. The circle is situated on the summit of Beltany Hill in good land with excellent views. Sixty metres to the SW of the stone circle and on a slight terrace just below the summit of the hill, is a circular area (DG070-025----) 35m in diameter, open on the W side but defined elsewhere by stone-wall field boundaries. The area is marked as a 'Graveyard' on the 1st edition of the OS 6-inch maps and as an 'Old Graveyard' on the 2nd edition. It is not clear what the exact nature of this site was but its proximity to the stone circle might suggest that they were in some way related.

Cashelenny,Donegal,DG02490,STCI,Stone circle,54.62197,-7.734929,"The following description is derived from Cody (2000). The ‘stone circle complex at Cashelenny, County Donegal, is sited on bog-grown upland some 10 km. north-east of Pettigo . . . . The site was known to Oliver Davies who conducted fieldwork in County Donegal in the 1940s and 1950s. In his notes in the topographical files in the National Museum of Ireland, Dublin, he identified it as a complex of stone circles and alignments and through his work it came to be included in the Archaeological Survey of County Donegal where it is briefly described (Lacy 1983, 71). Some years later Claire Foley of the Environment and Heritage Service, Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland, whose attention had been drawn to the site by Michael McSorley of Castlederg. County Tyrone, alerted my former colleague, Dr Sean Ó Nualláin, to its significance. In August 1991, accompanied by Mr McSorley, the writer and Dr Ó Nualláin visited the complex and in September of that year it was surveyed. The monument is exposed in a 30m. - 35m. wide strip of cut-away bog which extends for something in excess of 120m. in a north-easterly direction from the environs of an abandoned house. This turf-cutting is old work and there would not appear to be any local memory of it. The surface of the cut-away strip is approximately 1m. below that of the surrounding bog. As none of the stones of the monument rise more than 75cm. above the cut-away surface it is likely that they had been wholly enveloped before turf-cutting took place. There would still seem to be a 40cm. thickness of peat at the site, the surface of which is now under a lighlt growth of grass and heather.The monument stands between 600 and 700 feet O.D. (183-213m.) on a gentle south-facing slope on the south-western spur of Crockarthur, which spans the boundary between Donegal and Tyrone. This hill is one of a series along a belt of hill and mountain country, lying between the Derg River to the north and the Termon River to the south, which stretches eastwards from Lough Derg in County Donegal almost to Drumquin in County Tyrone. Northwards from the monument the ground rises gently and just 50m. away drops sharply to a narrow valley which forms the north side of the spur. The outlook from the site is limited by relatively close horizons formed by hill-ridges except to the south. In the latter direction there is an extensive view across Lough  Nageage, 0.6 km. away, and beyond it along the basin of the Termon River in the direction of Lower Lough Erne. The accompanying plan shows the 134 stones that were visible at the date of survey. Of the 134 only nine are 40cm. or more high, 101 stones are no more than 15cm. high and shout half of these scarcely rise clear of the cut-away surface. Many of the stones at the sire are clearly set on an end or edge and while the status of a considerable number of low stones must remain somewhat uncertain it is considered likely that the great majority are in situ. A very small number appear to be prostrate, as if they might have fallen or been uprooted, and these are shown in outine on the plan. Four classically-sited features are identified. At the south-west there is a stone circle and some 5m. to the north-east, and slightly upslope, there is a larger sub-circular feature, possibly also a stone circle, in the interior of which there are set stones. Between the two circles there is a row of stones and at the north-eastern end of the complex there are a number of stones, perhaps another linear setting. The stone circle at the south-west, part of which is still enveloped in bog, is some 10m in diameter. None of the stones forming the circle rises more than 30cm. above the cut-away surface. For the most part there are gaps between the stones, though two stones at the south-west at the point it exits the bog are almost contiguous while the next two stones are set end to end but it is possible that this pair originally formed one stone. The second circle measures abo", https://maps.archaeology.ie/HistoricEnvironment/?SMRS=DG102-001----

Marfagh,Donegal,DG02944,BASC,Stone circle - embanked,55.187209,-8.021544,"Situated on flat pasture on a headland with panoramic views of the Atlantic Ocean and Tory Island to W and N with upland area to E and overlooked by rock outcrop immediately to S. Site consists of a slightly sunken circular shaped interior (diam 28.1m N-S ; 32m E-W) enclosed by a mixture of low upright stones and rock outcrop which has been quarried to form a revetment or kerbing defining a roughly circular shaped interior. The best preserved upright orthostats can be seen on the SE side where the tallest stone measures 0.85m H by 0.6m by 0.67m. This stone appears to be set into a socket with packing stones around its base. On the outer face of these stones on the SE side there is the slightest suggestion of a low denuded bank which may have been built up against the outer face of these upright stones. There is no enclosing element from ENE through E to ESE as this appears to have been levelled when the interior was used for tillage. There is evidence of cultivation ridges running across the interior of the enclosure. The interior of the enclosure rises slightly from what appears to be a low mound, although this rise may be due to later disturbance.This circle or enclosure is situated amongst a field system (DG015-031002-) of unknown date. A field bank runs off the N side of the enclosure and runs down to the cliff edge while a second low field bank intersects the ENE side of the enclosure and runs off to the E of the monument. The extensive remains of a field system (DG015-031002-) and field clearance cairns (DG015-031001/003-) can be seen to the NE and E of the monument.The classification of this monument is problematical as it appears to fall between the stone circle and embanked enclosure classification. It is possible that this monument may be the remains of poorly preserved embanked stone circle which is contemporaneous with the associated field system.

Magheracar,Donegal,DG03394,STCI,Stone circle,54.475497,-8.316488,"Excavation licence number 01E0683. Testing, monitoring and excavation by Christopher Read of  North West Archaeological Services took place in advance of a twenty-house development at Magheracar, Bundoran, on the Leitrim/Donegal border. The proposed development site lies within an archaeological complex that includes a passage tomb, a wedge tomb and two standing stones. All of these monuments will be protected by the requisite buffer zones and will not be affected by the proposed development. Geophysical surveying had revealed a number of anomalies that may indicate subsurface archaeological features. These were investigated through the manual excavation of four 20m by 20m areas. Two of these cuttings revealed possible archaeological features in the form of burnt areas and linear cut features. These cuttings were extended to discover the full extent of these features before excavation. At the same time, the remainder of the site was stripped of its topsoil, under supervision. Upon excavation, the cut features in Cutting C were interpreted as possible furrows of unknown date. There were no associated finds. The burnt areas in Cutting D were further exposed and excavated, revealing a large corn-drying kiln with two flues. The topsoil-stripping of the remainder of the site revealed two other areas of archaeological activity. An isolated collared urn filled with cremated material, completely intact and situated upright, was uncovered and barely missed by the machine. It was removed in a block of soil, relatively in one piece, and is in the process of being excavated in the lab by a conservator. Approximately 20m east of the urn, the remains of a circular stone platform were uncovered. Approximately 6m wide, this semicircle, comprising three concentric rings of flat stone slabs, was set in a low earth and stone mound. The northern half of this feature appears to have been removed without trace sometime in antiquity. Nothing was found within the circle or the mound except for two small blue glass beads and a few pieces of struck chert. A Bronze/Iron Age date for the feature is likely although its purpose has yet to be fully explored. A number of stray finds came from the topsoil across the site, most of which comprised struck chert and flint. A single hollow-based limestone arrowhead and a stone axe were included in the finds.

Moanmore East,Galway,GA05796,BASC,Stone circle - embanked,53.188399,-8.53115,"On a ridge in pastureland, immediately to the S of the Loughrea-Portumna road. Named the ‘Seven Monuments’ and shown within a large mixed forest on the OS 6-inch maps, this National Monument was known locally as 'Feara Breige'. It was described in Dutton’s Statistical Survey of 1824 as a mound where there were ‘formerly eight flat rude stones’, but one was missing, five were still standing and two were lying flat on the bank. In the centre was a ‘tumulus’ and the entire site was planted with trees (O'Flanagan 1927, Vol. 2, 239). The trees have since been removed from the monument but traces of the plantation survive immediately to its S and around its W limits and a house has been built to its SE. Traces of lazy beds, running roughly NE-SW are visible immediately to its S. This embanked stone circle (30.15m N-S) is defined by a raised roughly circular area that is enclosed by a well-preserved mainly earthen flat-topped bank (Wth at N 0.8m; int. H 0.5m; ext. H 0.8m) that is clearly visible all round. An outhouse built in the early 1980s clips it a SE (SMR file). There is small gap (base Wth 0.7m) in the bank at SE. The seven boulders are still extant: two at NW and N are lying flat and the other five at NE, E, SE, SSE and SSW are upright. Within the interior, roughly centrally located, is a small cairn (1.8m N-S; H 0.35-0.7m). A low berm (Wth 11.7m) visible around it slopes gently towards the bank. There is no visible surface trace of a fosse. Knox (1915, 310-11) recorded traces of an outer bank to the N, E and S. It is now only clearly visible from N to NE (L c. 16.4m; Wth 0.5m; int. H 1.7m; ext. H 1m). Here a field wall is built outside it and there is a sharp drop (H 1.8m) to the road below. Otherwise only slight intermittent traces are evident from SW to N and this area is densely overgrown with scrub and trees. Knox (1915-16, 72) suggested that the central cairn was possibly an Ordnance Survey station and an excavation by Macalister (1916-17, 506-7), which proved that it was of recent origin, may back this up. The upstanding stones range in height from 1.08m to 1.56m and packing stones are visible at the base of some. Most are partially covered with moss and lichen. The top of the stone (L c. 0.2m; Wth 0.2m) at WSW is fairly flat and bears a roughly square tenon-like feature (H 0.02m; L 0.05m; Wth 0.05m), again suggesting a possible link with an OS trigonometrical station.

This stone circle (int. diam. c. 4m) lies in the centre of an earthen enclosure (int. diam. c. 20m) (KE067-020001-). The stone circle, which is comprised of seven stones (L 0.5-1.2m; T 0.4-1m; H 0.9-1.2m), was regarded by Ó Nualláin (1984a, 25, no. 38) as typical of the Cork-Kerry series, with the stones decreasing in height as they appraoch the axial stone at SW. A recent interpretation by O'Brien (2004, 329), however, concluded that the identification of the axial stone and the associated orientation are open to question. The enclosure is defined by an earthen bank (Wth 3.4m; int. H 1m; ext. H 0.8m), partially obscured by trees and bushes, and has breaks at NE and SW. A limited excavation in 1998 revealed the presence of a steep-sided fosse (Wth 3m at top, 1m at base; D 2.5m) directly inside the enclosing bank and also confirmed that the enclosure (KE067-020001-) is prehistoric in date (O'Brien 2000, 94-5; 2004, 323-38).

A fifth stone standing to the southwest, appears to form an outlier. The stones are standing on a level break in a steep southeast facing slope, in an area of rough mountain pasture.  The site commands a view over the roiling land which lies to the east, southeast, south and southeast.  Beginning at east and running clockwise, the dimensions of each stone are as follows: Stone 1 measures 1.05m in height, 56cm in breadth and 49cm in width. The stone, which is roughly triangular in section, is aligned northeast-southwest and is separated by a distance of 92cm from stone 2, which lies to the southwest.  Stone 2 measures 80cm in height, 84cm in breadth and 59cm in width. The stone is aligned east west and is somewhat irregular in outline. A distance of 1.3m separates it from stone 3 which lies to the northwest.  Stone 3 measures 95cm in height, 79cm in breadth and c. 48cm in width. The stone, which tapers towards its north-west end, is aligned southeast-northwest. A distance of 45cm separates it from stone 4, which lies to the north of it.  Stone 4 is prostrate, measuring 1.05m in length, 46cm in breadth and 40cm in width. Stones 1 to 4 enclose an area roughly 3m north-south and 2.6m east-west.  The outlier, stone 5, stands c. 2m southwest of stone 3.  It measures 1.25 in height, 96cm in breadth and c. 59cm in width. The stone, which is rectangular in section, is aligned east west.

The site was disturbed and the stones were overturned by people searching for gold (Vol. 1, 1941, 180). Unfortunately the exact location of the site was not recorded in the above extract. However, its probable location was indicated to the author in April 1990, by the owner of this land. He recalled having seen one large stone at this site, to the east of which stood six or seven smaller stones in a circle. Today a stone, measuring 1.65m in height, c 1.40m in breadth and 80cm in width, stands at the site. It is bordered on the south by a field fence, running roughly southeast northwest. The stone, which is of sandstone, is roughly triangular in section and aligned east-west. The 2m gap which lies between the stone and the field fence, is occupied by stones which have obviously been cleared from elsewhere and just thrown there. A further jumble of stones lie at a distance of 28m roughly to the east of this stone. It is not possible to say whether or not these stones once formed a part of the monument or are merely stones gathered together in the course of field clearance. However, standing 2m to the south of these is another stone, roughly square in section and measuring 70cm in height, 75cm in breadth and 60cm in width. It consists of sandstone.  The field is under pasture, and in the general site area, slopes away to both the north and south, with a less obvious slope to the east. The site commands a view over the hillslope lying to the northwest, north and south, while the Paps mountains are visible in the distance to the southeast'.

According to Ó Nualláin (1984a, 28, no. 44), the stone circle was in a ruinous condition for many years and was reconstructed c. 1964 and most likely now bears little resemblance to its original form. It now consists of a U-shaped arrangement of loosely set upright stones with a possible boulder-burial (KE101-007002-) in the centre.

This incomplete stone circle (diam. c. 40m) consists of 19 stones arranged in a roughly D-shaped configuration with two stones at ENE, adjacent to the road-side fence, giving a straight edge to the circle on this side. Neither of these stones appears to be set in the ground and they may be displaced. The arrangement of the other surviving stones supports the interpretation of it being a true ‘circle’ and, if this is correct, then the entire monument is contained to the SW of the road which, as a routeway, would have respected its presence in skirting its N perimeter. A number of the stones are set contiguously while others are widely spaced. Nine of the stones are upright monoliths set on edge with their axes along the perimeter of the circle. One of these, the eighth in order from the road-side field boundary at ENE, is atypical in having its axis at an angle to the perceived line of the circle. The remaining stones are either recumbent or, in the case of the two at ENE nearest the road-side fence, possibly displaced. The highest stone (H 1.7m; Wth 1.1m; T 0.8m) is at SE  and the largest recumbent stone (L 1.95m; Wth 0.98m; T 0.59m) is at ESE.

In certain instances the entries have been revised and updated in the light of recent research. Date of upload/revision: 17 July 2007  Eight regularly-spaced stones enclosing an oval area (7m by 4m), reputedly exposed by Lord Clermont c. 1840 (CLAJ 1906, 96).

Tempest (CLAJ 1942, 128-32) suggests that the origins of the monument may be doubtful owing to the small area of the circle, the surface mobility of the stones and the irregular spacing. This may be partly explained by the original lowering of the ground level around the stones to reveal them and their constant re-setting by estate workmen.   Borlase (1897, vol. 2, 421) records the location of the site, or one exactly similar, as being at Dromiskin. This was also a Clermont estate, and thus confusion may have arisen. The site has been suggested as part of landscaping by Lord Clermont, but may equally be part of a genuine prehistoric site, though Davies (UJA 1939, 13) does note that it does not conform to any known circle type.", https://maps.archaeology.ie/HistoricEnvironment/?SMRS=LH004-002001-

Grange (Smallcounty By.),Limerick,LI03003,BASC,Stone circle - embanked,52.515315,-8.544464,"National monument in state ownership No. 247.  The levelled possible embanked stone circle with adjoining megalithic structure (LI032-003----) is located in grassland 550m W of Lough Gur with Limerick-Cork road immediately to E.  According to Professor Robert Harkness (1869, 389-90) the monument was levelled some time in the early 1830s during the construction of the adjoining Limerick-Cork mail road.   This levelled monument is located in an area with a large concentration of prehistoric monuments.  Two standing stones (LI032-009-/010002-) lie 255m and 340m respectively to the NE,  two stone circles (LI032-006----/005) lie 150m to E, a roadway depicted as 'Cladh na Leac' (LI032-010001-) running roughly N-S lies 375m to E.  Grange embanked stone circle (LI032-004001-) with site of megalithic structure depicted as Dolmen (Site of) (LI032-004002-) stands 150m to SSE,  a standing stone marked as 'Cloch á bhíle' stands 275m to SSE with a levelled megalithic structure (LI032-010003-)  depicted as 'Giants Grave (Site of) lies 465m to SSE.   Grange Castle (LI032-001002-) and Cathar Chinn Chon (LI032-001002-) stands 215m to W.      No monument is depicted at this location on the first edition Ordnance Survey [OS] 6-inch map.  However on the revised 1927 edition OS map, the monument is hachured as an oval-shaped platform which is annotated by the OS as a 'Stone Circle (Site of)' with a 'Stone Avenue' (LI032-003----) immediately to SSE depicted as a small oval shaped setting of 7 orthostats.             Harbison (1970, 155) suggested that the monument may have been the remains of a megalithic tomb.   However in 1869 Professor Harkness described the site as a stone circle which had been partially destroyed during the construction of the adjoining Limerick-Cork mail road.  He recorded the following details about this monument: ‘A short distance N.W of these three circles (LI032-005-/006-/004001), and in a field adjoining the Limerick high-road, there are other traces of prehistoric remains.  These occur in the form of a few large blocks of stone arranged in a double row (LI032-003----).  They may have originally formed the western side of the large imperfect circle, having been removed from thence when the road was being made.  There is also in the same field a large cup-shaped depression about 210 paces in diameter, but whether this is a natural or an artificial production there is not sufficient evidence at present to determine’ (Harkness 1869, 389-90).  This cup-shaped depression may be a reference to an embanked stone circle.  In 1895 the monument was described as following; ‘About one hundred and twenty yards north-west of the chief circle [LI032004001-], at the opposite side of the main road to Limerick, there is a cup-shaped circle with a diameter of two hundred and thirty feet.  Not a stone is now left in this circle, the last having been taken away about sixty years ago. There are traces of this circle having been formerly surrounded by a rath. An avenue (LI032-003----) bordered on each side with stones much sunk in the ground, of which only thirteen are now left, meets the circle at the north-east side. The avenue is about thirty feet wide, but it narrows as it approaches the circles, and right in the middle of it, near the circle, there is a stone much buried in the ground. The stones are very irregularly placed, and some have been shifted from their original positions’ (Lynch 1895, 300).  Today the outline of a roughly oval-shaped area (approx. diam. 85m N-S;  62m E-W) is visible on Digital Globe aerial photograph.  The S side of this levelled earthwork was intersected by a levelled field boundary depicted on the first edition of the OS 6-inch map.

Grange (Smallcounty By.),Limerick,LI03005,BASC,Stone circle - embanked,52.514266,-8.541917,"National monument in state guardianship No. 247.  Situated in grassland on top of low rise of ground 350m W of Lough Gur and surrounded by a cluster of prehistoric monuments.  Two stone circles (LI032-005-/006----) in adjoining field to N, a trackway running NW-SE known as Cladh na Leac (LI032-010001-) 210m to E, site of standing stone known as Cloch á Bhíle (LI032-007----) 60m to SSE, site of Giant's Grave (LI032-010003-) possibly a megalithic structure 245m to SSE, site of a  possible megalithic tomb/portal tomb (LI032-004002-) immediately to WSW, a trapezoidal setting of stones (LI032-002----) annotated as a 'Stone Avenue' which may be remains of a court tomb (Cleary 2015, 51)  standing beside an embanked stone circle (LI032-003---) 120m to WNW.   Embanked stone circle consisting of a slightly raised near perfect circular-shaped area (int. diam. 45.7m) defined by 113 contiguous orthostats (max. H 4m) serving as internal facing for a wide flat-topped earth and stone bank (Wth 9m; H 1-2m) with cobbled entrance gap (Wth 1m) at E flanked by tall orthostats ( H 2-2.2m). The entrance to the circle is marked by the tallest stones and these are mirrored on the opposite side, creating an alignment on the midsummer moon (June 24)  (Halpin and Newman 2006, 415).   Facing the two entrance stone at WSW are two tall orthostats with tops sloping down to each forming a V-shaped notch. It has been suggested that the stones were aligned upon the early November sunset, the festival of Samhain (8 November) (Windle 1912, 287; Burl 1995, 238). The heaviest of the stones, a very large cube known as 'Rannach Croim Duibh' meaning 'the prominent black stone', weighing over twenty tons, was set at the NE towards the midsummer sunrise (ibid.).   The stone circle was restored around the 1870's and new stones appear to have been erected over the decades, creating the 113 that are visible today (Cleary 2015, 52).   In 1827 the stone circle was described as follows -  measuring one 'hundred and thirty feet [39.6m] across. Only forty-three stones of various dimensions remain forming a perfect circle; some of them are very small, while one in the north-east part of the circle is seven feet and a half [2.3m] high by five [1.5m] in breadth ; nearly opposite to it stands another very little smaller. Many of the intermediate stones have been removed, and a part of the north side of the circumference has been much disturbed by a ditch lately made close to it. The whole of this southern circle is surrounded by a mound about fifteen feet [4.5m] broad and about four feet [1.2m] high, which skirts along the outside edge of the stones, enclosing the area within them as a pit of three or four feet [0.9-1.2m] deep' (Beaufort 1828, 139).  Windle (1912, 288–91) recorded the existence of 113 orthostats forming the inner ring and also recorded that the entrance passage was discovered by ‘some men digging for treasure’ (1912, 287).  The site, titled by Ó Riordáin, as the 'Great Stone Circle (B) was excavated in 1939, who found the outlines of up to five shallow, annular trenches in the interior. Ó Ríordáin (1951, 41–2) was of the opinion that most of the stones were original and recorded 113, of which six numbered stones (72, 77–79, 86 and 94) were indicated as modern insertions and 107 as original in the circle. He suggested that the entrance was only cleared of overgrowth and collapsed material and that there was ‘no indication of the fill having been disturbed’ (Ó Ríordáin 1951,48).  Ó Ríordáin found that the bases of some of the circle stones were set in sockets, while other stones were standing on the old ground surface, supported by packing stones and gravel (Ó Ríordáin 1951, 45–6). Lithic finds from Ó Ríordáin’s 1939 excavation included about 400 struck stone artefacts, of which the majority were flint but which included about twenty chert fragments (Cleary 2015, 55).

At least three stones of the circle survive today incorporated into the W field boundary that was a roadway on the first ed. OS 6-inch map.  These surviving stones are depicted on the 25-inch OS map.    The Ordnance Survey 6-inch map has incorrectly marked the location of this stone circle.   Based on 19th century antiquarian reports the monument consisted of a circular-shaped area (diam. 52m) delimited by seventy-two orthostats the majority of which were removed in the 1830s.     On the first ed. OS 6-inch map the stone circle is incomplete as it was intersected at W by a roadway running N-S which today survives as a field boundary.  A line of roadside buildings are depicted on the E side, the remains of which are no longer visible.  Originally the stone circle may have extended into the field to the W of this roadway.   The stone circle was described in 1826 as ‘another circle fifty yards in diameter, consisting of seventy-two smaller stones standing’ (Fitzgerald ad McGregor 1826, 298). In 1840 the Ordnance Survey letters described the monument as following; ‘Fifty feet [15m] southwest of this circle [LI032-006----] there is a second, measuring one hundred and sixty feet [49m] in diameter.  Sixty stones only are left, in some parts standing quite close together, in others a wide gap between.  These stones are all abut three feet [0.9m] in height, and the ground around and within the circle is perfectly level’ (OSL 1840, 249). By 1895 most of the orhtostats had been removed and the stone circle was now described as; '‘About thirty yards due north of the chief circle [LI032-004001-] there is another circle with a diameter of one hundred and seventy feet [52m]. It has no rath, and only six pillar stones are left.  In Fitzgerald's time [1820s] there were seventy-two stones in this circle, but about sixty-five years ago [1830s] it was destroyed by Mr. Edward Croker, of Grange.  Ten yards east of this circle, and ninety-three yards from the gate of the chief circle, there is a third circle [LI032-006----], also without a rath’ (Lynch 1895, 300).

The presence of an outlying recumbent stone a few yards E of circle no longer survives.  It has been suggested that the gap at SSW was created by the removal of two orthostats (O'Kelly and O'Kelly 1978, 13).  Aerial photographs taken in 1966 show the stone circle enclosing a low central mound with the remains of an enclosing bank also visible (CUCAP APC076/077/078)The small stone circle with an outlying recumbent stone to E but now removed was described in 1826 as ‘a third, which is but seventeen yards in diameter, and composed of fifteen large rocks standing erect.  A few yards to the E of these is a large stone lying flat, seven feet and a half [2.2m] in length, six [1.8m] in height, and four and a half [1.3m] in breadth, which is generally supposed to have been the altar for sacrifice’ (Fitzgerald and McGregor 1826, 298).

Situated on S facing slope or rising ground at the base of Knockfennel Hill, now standing 40m N of the NW shoreline of Lough Gur.  On the first edition of the OS 6-inch map the ringfort is shown standing on the edge of the shoreline of Lough Gur.  Ringfort stands on N side of Lough Gur, S of Knockfennell and to the NE of Ardaghlooda Hill.  Loughgur House stands 300m to NW.  Cashel (LI032-014006-) 195m to N, adjacent field system (LI032-014004-), stone circle (LI032-014005-) and possible settlement platform (LI032-014002-)  50m to W.  Garret Island in the centre of Lough Gur 180m to S, with crannóg (LI032-012----) 300m to W.    In 1944 the D-shaped ringfort (LI032-014003-) with adjoining field system (LI032-014004-), and an arc of low orthostats to SE was described as following; 'The fort (LI032-014003-) is partly carved out of the hill slope, which is steep on the N side of it and it is only on this side that a fosse occurs. On the S there is none as here the ground falls away from the monument and a certain amount of building up had to be done to make the structure approximately level, though it still has a considerable slope to the S.   The fort is the central feature of a system of ancient fences (LI032-014004-) which cover the lower slopes of a hill on this side. These fences are mainly earthen and among them are discernible a number of small enclosures or huts.  On the SE side of it is the arc of stones described above' (O'Kelly 1944, 48). This arc of stones was described by O'Kelly (1944, 47) as following; 'An arc of 8 fairly large stones situated close to the edge of the lake at the SW base of Knockfennel Hill. If the arc were completed to form a circle its diam. would be 50' [15m] approx.  Situated 21' [6m] due N of the W end of the arc is an earthen fort [LI032-014003-], so that if the arc were complete and still in existence at the time of the building of the fort, a large part of the circle would be covered by it. There is no evidence that this is so and it is quite possible that the arc is a chance formation of stones'. Today the outline of the roughly D-shaped ringfort with traces of a field system to NW are clearly visible on Digital Globe aerial photograph.  The arc of stones may be visible to the SE of the ringfort as small white dots.

Loughgur,Limerick,LI03127,STCI,Stone circle,52.522091,-8.510479,"In pasture within a flat field on the S lower slope of Knocksentry Hill also known as Knockroe, 650m E of the NE shore of Lough Gur. A cist burial cemetery (LI032-055----) is located 140m to NW; Circle O (LI032-060----) lies 40m to SW and Circle P (LI032-059---) is located 100m to S; as are a number of other mound sites (LI032-058/-321).The stone circle is not depicted on any OSi historic maps. The site is not visible on the OSi orthoimage taken 2005-12 or on Digital Globe orthoimages taken 2011-2013.  Barry (1900, 374) recorded that ‘the remarkable group of three stone forts on Knockroe, east of the lake, is not marked on the Ordnance Survey. At present there are only two, but Croker's map shows a third east of the existing ones’. The assumption is that first two sites are Circle O (LI032-060----) and Circle P (LI032-059---) and the third site to the ‘east’ is LI032-058----.  O’Kelly (1944, 24) recounted Corker (1833, 110) and described LI032-058---- as having ‘stood beside Circles O and P        No trace of it is now visible and there is no memory of it in the neighbourhood. It measured 28 yards [25.5m] and 113 [103m] in circumference’.  The approximate location of the site is visible on Google Earth orthoimages taken 28/06/2018 and 20/09/2020.

Loughgur,Limerick,LI03129,BASC,Stone circle - embanked,52.521504,-8.511032,"National monument No. 247.  Monument depicted as a two circular-shaped setting of stones on current ed. OS 25 inch map and shown standing 20m NNW of a small burial mound (LI032-059----) on the Hill of Knockroe.   Described in 1833 as one of three stone circles (LI032-058----/59----) standing on the Hill of Knockroe (Croker 1833, 109).  Croker listed this site as 'N1' and recorded the following about the monument; 'Of these No. 1 was the most perfect. It measured in circumference one hundred and ninety-two yards, and had two or perhaps three circles of stones within the outward one. The centre of these circles measured fourteen yards in diameter' (ibid.).  In 1912 this monument was listed as 'Stone Circle O' and described as following; 'The greater or northern circle is locally-called the Lisheen. As the figures 16 and 17 show, it has been disfigured by the fact that an earthen wall has been run right through from east to west and slightly to the north of the middle line, and that the eastern side has also been much broken up walls. As the section (fig. 19) shows, this circle consists of (1) a circular bank with (a) a circle of stones surrounding and standing up from its outer border, and (b) a stone wall of slabs lining the upper bank directed towards the centre of the circle. (2) A central bank surrounded by a series of stones along its outer edge.  It would appear therefore that the bank supporting the inner circle, and possibly also that of the outer circle, had been heaped up from earth in the interior of the space, and this will therefore account for the fact that the floor between the two circles is at a lower level than the circumjacent field. The outer circle, as already stated, is very much broken up ; and it is impossible to say of how many stones it may originally have consisted, or even with any approach to certainty how many of the stones now existing belong to the ancient structure. There are thirty-three stones in the central circle (see fig. 17), most of them being placed very close to one another. They are of tabular limestone, and the highest is 4 feet [1.2m]. This inner circle for a short distance on the eastern side is doubled - that is to say, there is a pathway between two rows of the stones. Fifteen feet east of this double-ranked portion is a straight bank co-extensive in length with the double-ranked part, and bordered by four smaller-sized stones. There is no other sign of double ranking in this circle. The double-ranked part is 11 feet wide where it exists, and 30 feet [10m] in length. The bank with the four stones is therefore also 30 feet [10m] ' (Windle 1912, 302-03).   This monument was described by O'Kelly (1944, 26) as following; 'This circle, called locally ""The Lisheen"" has been excavated.  It consists of an earthen bank with a facing of stone on each side.  Inside this, excavation showed that there was a fosse.  In the centre is a small circle of free standing stones concentric with the outer stone faced bank.  The diameter of the outer circle is 184' [56m] and that of the inner small one is 49' [15m].  No dating evidence was discovered'.   In 1978 the monument was described as following; 'It is 56m in overall diam. and consists of an earthen bank faced on both sides with standing slabs of stone.  The position of the original entrance is not known.  Excavation showed that there was a ditch inside the bank and beyond the ditch there was an annular space surround a central circle of contiguous stones.  The inner circle was 15m in overall diam.  In the NE quadrant of the circle a pile of boulders was revealed which ahd been thrown together without any apparent arrangement.  there were no finds and hence the date is unknown.  Because of the finding of a ditch inside the bank, the site is considered to have been a ritual one'   (O'Kelly and O'Kelly 1978, 24-5).

Patrickswell,Limerick,LI03139,STCI,Stone circle,52.496139,-8.511135,"National monument No. 247.  Situated at the base of the W facing slope on the Hill of Knockderc/Knockderk with good views of the surrounding countryside.  Depicted as a conjoined setting of stones forming two C-shaped areas open to E and annotated as 'Stone Circles' on the 25-inch OS map.  In 1833 the presence of possible stone circles was recorded as following; 'Along the road leading from its Cross towards Kilmallock, other circles and Druidical works are obvious, under a hill called Knockderk, marked Q in the plan' (Croker 1833, 112).  In 1913 Lynch recorded that 'the stone circles at the foot of Knockderk, described by Crofton Croker in his article on Lough Gur, are there still' (Lynch 1913, 19).   O'Kelly doubted the existence of these stone circles when he recorded the following about the monument on Knockderc Hill; 'There are four circles marked on the O.S. map on this hill.  Three are on the W base and one on the top near the highest point.  In fact, they do not exist and it is doubtful if they ever did exist.  the site on top of the hill shows some ancient field fences and a rather doubtful circular enclosure, but there is no trace of a stone circle.  The W base of the hill is strewn all over with large blocks of basaltic rock which have rolled down from higher up.  If one selects suitable stone from among these and eliminates others, any number of circles can be formed.  It must have been in this way that three circles came to be marked on the O.S. map' (O'Kelly 1944, 31).

"Ballynamona (Smallcounty By., Hospital Ed)",Limerick,LI03195,STCI,Stone circle,52.496595,-8.44967,"Stone Circle described in 1943 as following; 'Only in the north-east arc of this circle are the stones remaining fairly perfectly in their original positions (Fig. 10). Many have gone altogether on the north-west and south sides. In the remaining arc the stones are almost contiguous and are nearly all of limestone, but a few are of volcanic breccia. A modern fence has been built in an east-west direction across the circle. This almost passes through the centre. On the north-west arc of the circle where the stones are gone there is a ""step-down"" to the level of the field outside. This is not apparent elsewhere. It is due to the fact that the packing of small stones which held the large stones in place has remained. The circle was tilled in 1941.  In ploughing, the above mentioned stone packing suffered very much. During the tillage nothing was found. The overall diameter is 110' [33.5m] and the greatest height of any of the stones does not exceed 4' [1.2m], the average height being about 3' [0.9m]. All the stones are rough boulders rather than standing stones' (O'Kelly 1942-3, 178).   The outline of the monument is clearly visible today on Digital Globe aerial photographs.

Described by Rynne (1969, 90) as a small stone circle (diam. 4.5m) of seven stones (H 0.3m) with an outlier to the E. The recumbent slab now acting as a cap stone may be one of the orthostats of the stone circle described by Rynne in 1963. Inside the pit there is a small slab which may also have been one of the original orthostats. The land has been reclaimed and reseeded with grass which may have resulted in levelling of the stone circle. When the stone circle was being levelled the land owner may have come across a deep pit inside the circle which he may have then lined with concrete on top of which he placed one of the original orthostats of the circle. In Rynne's description of the site he mentions some irregularities in the ground inside the stone circle and suggested it may have been the remains of a cairn. Could the concrete lined pit be the remains of a cist which may have been converted into a concrete lined well during drainage of the field?

Disturbed remains of a circle of granite blocks (int. diam. 23m) at the high N end of a small steep-sided ridge. There are sixteen stones in the area of the site of which only five are in situ; of the others, five are prostrate but probably close to their original position, three are clearly displaced while the remaining two are too small to have been original components. The stones in situ vary in height from 1.3m to 1.92m but (contra Burl 1976, 234) the pair at the NE are not the highest stones in the circle although their position, facing the outlier ('The Piper') 40m further to the NE, suggests that they may mark the entrance. The OS Letters (O'Flanagan 1928, 114) describe twenty-nine stones including displaced examples and record a then recent attempt to plant the site with trees. A trench dug around the inner edge of the circle was noted and also the presence of a bank between the stones which may be the origin of the low bank now visible between the stones at the SE. The outlier (WI015-010001-) occurs downslope to the E and is a large cup-marked glacial erratic (H 1.95m; diam. c. 2.9m).

The monument consists of 11 stone uprights with a single small recumbent stone (possible axial stone) located due north. The internal diameter of the site measures 12.5m east-west and 13m north-south. There is regular spacing between the six stones to the southwest of the circle (ranging from 1.0m-1.7m) with the tallest pointed stone located to the northeast (1.7m high, 1.12m wide and 250mm thick). To the south of this stone (1.50m), a partially buried stone was visible in the bank that surrounds the circle, the visible portion of this stone measures 1.10m in length and is approximately 600mm wide and 200mm thick. This may be a fallen stone belonging to this monument.  Price (1934) described the stone circle as follows: '45 feet [13.7m] in diameter, and approximately 140 feet [42.6m] in circumference; there are eleven stones standing, and there is the stump of a twelfth stone in the circle, almost level with the ground. The six stones standing on the west side are evenly spaced about 4 feet [1.2m] apart. The stone which stands to the NE of the centre of the circle is 6 feet 3 inches [1.9m] high, the other ten vary from 3 [0.9m] to 4.5 feet [1.4m] in height: the tall stone at the NE is pointed, of regular shape, with a flat inner face, which has natural markings caused by weathering running down it. The stones appear to be of local grit’.  Burl noted in his drawing of the stone circle, the remnants of a low bank behind the stones at Boleycarrigeen (Lynch 1979) and describes the site as being surrounded by a substantial bank about 1.8m wide and 0.9m high, making the site an excellent example of an embanked circle, similar to the Castleruddery stone circle (National Monument) which is located over 5km to the northwest. Both these stone circles form part of the Wicklow/ Kildare stone circle group, remarkable for their distinctive regional characteristics, and are the better-known examples in the group (Stout 1994).   Burl also records 11 stones and a stump, all of local shale, remaining out of a hypothetical 18 in a 13.9m diameter circle. The stones are evenly spaced approximately 1.2m apart (Burl 1995, 249).  This monument is subject to a preservation order made under the National Monuments Acts 1930 to 2014 (PO no. 106/1940).

An Machaire,Donegal,DG03622,BASC,Stone circle - embanked,54.935913,-8.447582,Situated on a low rise of ground in an area of rock outcrop overlooking a sea inlet known as Casloughtermon to the E. The ruins of Templecrone Church (DG048-008001-) can be seen 435m to the NE overlooking the N shoreline of Casloughtermon. The W shoreline of this inlet is 60m E of the possible stone circle.  An iregular shaped enclosure which may be the wall footings of a large house site (DG048-012----) are located c. 20m to the NE.  The site consists of a circular area (int. diam. c. 16m) enclosed by a circle of contiguous upright orthostats (avg. H 0.5m) with no evidence of an entrance gap into the circle.  In some places there is evidence or traces of a possible bank or small packing stones supporting the base of an on the external face of the upright stones.  The monument is located in a field known as the 'Rath Liath [Grey Fort]' (Pers. comm. J. Doherty 21/10/2011) and may be the remains of a denuded cashel rather than a stone circle but the lack of a clearly defined entrance feature and the single upright stones suggests that it may be the remains of a stone circle.

Skeheen (Nagle),Westmeath,WM04131,STCI,Stone circle,53.411078,-7.558612,Situated on poorly drained grassland with possible moated site (WM031-115---) immediately to SSW.  Present remains consist of a circular area (diam. 7m) defined by 12 low circular shaped boulders (max. H 0.8m) set approx. 0.6-1.3m apart with single standing stone (H 0.5m) in centre of circle.  The stones are loosely placed on the ground and do not appear to be set into sockets.  The upright stone in the centre of the circle is also not set securely into the ground.  The shape of the boulders forming the circle and the way they are placed on the surface of the ground casts doubt on the antiquity of this monument.

Carn Beg,Louth,LH02758,STCI,Stone circle,54.028987,-6.4113,"Situated on a slight SW-facing slope. Wright (1758, vol. 3, 9-10, pl. 3) records and illustrates the remains of two concentric stone circles enclosed by an earthen bank with an external fosse. Outside this earthwork is a further stone circle enclosing all the other monuments. All the features were open to the E in the eighteenth century, probably because they were damaged by an avenue leading to Carn House, which is marked on the 1835 edition of the OS 6-inch map, and which now leads to the clubhouse of a golf course. There was an entrance, undoubtedly original, in the earthen bank at W, but both internal stone circles may have had an entrance at NW. Morris records (1907, 1, 4, 61) that the monument was completely removed at that time, but he probably sought it in Ballynahattin townland.  However, a text analysis revealed that Wright placed the monument ‘on the Planes (sic) of Ballynahaitinne', not in that townland as such (Buckley 1988, 53-4). The site is now recognised as the cropmark of a complex enclosure identified from an aerial photograph (CUCAP: BGL, 40) in the adjacent townland of Carn Beg. The cropmark is of a large enclosure (diam. c. 110m) defined by the negative mark of what is probably a wide earthen bank and traces of a fosse feature. In the interior are the negative cropmarks of two concentric gapped features (ext. diam. c. 50m int. diam. c. 30m), undoubtedly the stone circles which are S of the centre of the embanked enclosure. Archaeological testing (96E0321) immediately outside the embanked enclosure to the S failed to produce any related material (Murphy 1996).

Highpark,Limerick,LI08282,STCI,Stone circle,52.60484,-8.515943,"Situated on elevated grassland known locally as 'Knockfleming', with panoramic views of the surrounding countryside from W-N-E.  Hilltop ringfort (LI014-069--) visible 440m to SSE.   Standing stones (LI014-140---/041/042-) in fields 290m to E. High Park House located 1.3km to NNE.   In 1826 it was recorded that there was a 'stone circle near High Park, the residence of Joseph Gabbett, Esq. where a number of stones are to be seen, some lying in confusion, others in circles or direct lines.  It is remarkable that they are all round, and one large stone [LI014-024----], detached from the rest, stands erect, which measures nine feet [3m] in height, nearly the same in breadth, and is four feet [1.2m] thick on one side' (Fitzgerald 1826, 288). Lynch suggested that this standing stone (LI014-024----) was the 'large central stone of the stone circle' and that 'the other stones were removed many years ago' (Lynch 1896, 467).  A low scarp visible in places suggests the existence of an embanked stone circle or hilltop enclosure encircling this impressive standing stone.   Lynch (1911-13, 26) suggested that these stones were removed from Knockfleming 'over sixty years ago [c. 1850]'.

Rathiddy,Louth,LH02805,STCI,Stone circle,53.974296,-6.465503,"Situated on a slight E-facing slope. Issac Butler, writing in 1744 (Deane 1922, 99), noted ‘an arch (arc) of stones 7 paces (c. 5.25m) in diameter’ about 40 yards (c. 36m) to the SE of the standing stone (LH011-020----). The stones are described by Butler as being almost covered with grass but ‘pitched on end’, by which he meant upright. There is no evidence of such a feature now but it could have been a small stone circle like a kerb-circle. However, it is not extant and its precise location cannot be provided.

Eskine,Kerry,KE15622,STCI,Stone circle,51.899013,-9.830456,"Situated in boggy pasture, in a clearing partially enclosed by trees.. A stone circle (diam. 8.5–9m) composed of 8 stones (H: c.0.4–1.2m), the highest of which is located at N. Each of the stones is lichen encrusted on all sides which suggests the stones have been in their current positions for a long period of time. Packing stones are not visible. This stone circle is not characteristic of the multiple stone circles of Cork and Kerry in that it is composed of an even rather than an uneven number of stones and does not have a recumbent stone at SW. A fire setting in the centre of the stone circle appears modern. Immediately S of the circle is a low heap of modern field clearance material consisting of loose boulders and vegetation. A table-top boulder directly S of this heap has possibly been recently placed in this position as it is largely devoid of lichen encrustation and bears marks which appear to be machine lacerations. A semi-derelict house which is unoccupied is within sight of the stone circle 55m to SSE. Expansive views are afforded from the stone circle towards Mullaghanattin at N and NE. Due to modern dykes and ditches around the the circle as well as forestry and other vegetation, the circle itself is largely obscured from view other than from within close range.

Kilcorney,Clare,CL09746,STCI,Stone circle,53.033639,-9.155614,Within the SW end of a cairn associated with a possible unclassified megalithic tomb (CL009-021012-). A circle of seven upright stones (H c. 0.4m) encloses a small fairly level area (c. 2.5m NW–SE; c. 2m NE–SW). In the centre of this space a large roughly rectangular slab (1.3m NW–SE; NE–SW 0.95m) lies flat. A possible cist (CL009-021059-) lies to the S of the chamber of the tomb. Both of these features suggest that the possible tomb was subsequently reused.
