## Introduction

Several previous studies have found robust relationships between spatial properties of a country's **capital city** and that country's propensity for **conflict** and **misgovernance**.

Perceptions of this linkage also have an effect on "coup-proofing" decisions made by national governments. A recent BBC interview with Equatorial Guinea's President Teodoro Obiang, for example, highlighted this as a factor behind his decision to relocate the capital city:

> It's the remoteness of Oyala that makes it so appealing to President Obiang. In a rare interview he described how rebels had recently plotted a seaborne assault on his palace in the current capital, Malabo. 'We need a secure place for my government and for future governments. That's why we have created Oyala, to guarantee the government of Equatorial Guinea.' [@sackur_equatorial_2012]

This case is far from exceptional, as an even more recent *Washington Post* article points out with respect to Myanmar's decision to move its capital from Yangon to Naypyidaw:

> Analysts have described the decision as motivated by a desire to secure the military’s seat of power from any threat of protests or invasions. [@berger_myanmars_2021]

Most of these studies, however, are based on observations of **conflict events**. In this study, we study the more fundamental variable of a capital's distance from the **population centroid** of the country.

## Literature Review

@campante_capital_2019 analyzes the relationship between the location of a **capital city** and the degree of conflict and misgovernance in a given country. Their two key findings are that:

> Conflict is more likely to emerge (and dislodge incumbents) closer to the capital

and

> Isolated capitals are associated with misgovernance.

This first finding is illustrated in @fig-conflict-dist

## Methodology

The **population centroids** we use herein might require some explanation, since the term "centroid" can be ambiguous.

Here, the population centroids are drawn from @hall_population_2019

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Here we plot the base GIS objects we're analyzing: the location of each **capital city** (in purple) and each **population centroid** (in yellow).
